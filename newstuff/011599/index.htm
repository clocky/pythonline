<br><br><center><h2>My Audiences with Carol</h2>
<h3>by Erik D. Larsen</h3></center>


<p>Most Exalted Patroness,<br>
First Vice-President and Webmaster-General,<br>
Esteemed Members of the Society:</p>

<p>As you all know, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity and honor visiting Carol, our Most 
Exalted Patroness, during the last few days of 1998 and first few of 1999. It's now my great pleasure 
to submit my report on these meetings to you.</p>

<p>However, I feel a preliminary word of caution is in order. I'm neither  journalist, nor a shorthand 
expert. My intention was not to interview Her, but to meet and chat with Her socially. What I will 
report here are paraphrases of what went on and what was said between Carol and I, as remembered and 
noted down by myself in the evening of each day. Quotation marks do, however, signify direct quotes. 
For ease of reading, I've assigned each Carologically significant day of my visit its own section, 
and a descriptive title.</p>

<p>December 29, 1998: "Message For You, Sir!"</p>

<p>The 29th was my first full day in London. I'd arrived at my hotel  midmorning of the 28th, and 
immediately phoned my local contact,  Radford, to let him know I'd arrived. I spent the afternoon 
sightseeing in Trafalgar Square and visiting the National Gallery, and the evening at the Comedy 
Store.</p>

<p>I spent the late morning and early afternoon of the 29th at the Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI), 
the film and television museum on the south bank of the Thames, near the Waterloo train and Tube 
station. When I arrived back at the hotel at about 3:30 in the afternoon, a message from Carol was 
waiting for me. It read: "She'll meet you around 6:00 tomorrow at the theater, [but will] try to call 
you back later today." Of course, that made it impossible to leave again for the rest of the afternoon. 
I saw that the evening's performance was scheduled for 7 pm, and so I waited in my room for a possible 
callback until then. It didn't come, but I used the time to finish unpacking, and deciding what to do 
that evening. I finally decided on a West End comedy, "Love Upon the Throne," a two-man show in which 
the two performers enacted the meeting, courtship, marriage and divorce of Charles and Diana, playing 
all the parts themselves. I found the show absolutely hilarious: unfortunately, I left the program 
(for which I'd paid £2) in the restaurant where I had dinner afterwards.</p>

<p>December 30, 1998: "First Impressions"</p>

<p>This was <i>the</i> day - the day I'd been waiting for since I was about twelve, when I would finally get 
to meet Her Carolness for the first time. Honesty compels me to admit that I was a basket case - between 
the excitement and the noise from the street below, I didn't get much sleep. After breakfast, I looked 
for a flower shop, to purchase a bouquet of roses. Three florists I'd picked out of the phone book 
were closed over the holidays, and after tramping over most of the Marble Arch area, I was about to 
admit defeat and head back, when I spotted an open florist's on the other side of a street I'd 
already been down. I immediately dashed in and purchased a half-dozen red roses. Despite my efforts, 
I had no appetite for lunch, stopping only for a cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll from a bakery next 
door to the florist's.</p>

<p>Around two in the afternoon, my preparations began in earnest. I put in a new razor blade, shaved, 
applied aftershave and cologne, and then stood in front of the closet in my hotel room, deep in thought 
as I considered which of two sportcoats, four pairs of trousers, three shirts and four ties (or four 
mock-turtlenecks) to wear. For the next hour, I worried about my appearance as I never have before in 
my life, trying on most of the various combinations of the above, finally settling on my brand-new 
gray tweed jacket, dark blue cords, white shirt and red solid tie, even tucking a burgundy handkerchief 
into the breast pocket of my sportcoat.</p>

<p>Now I was dressed, it was time to make sure I had everything I'd need: roses, camera, spare film, 
pocket tape recorder, spare tape, a few papers, notebook, pens, watch, comb, wallet, keys, and most 
importantly, Carol's present. This was a pristine first edition of "Wicked: The Life and Times of the 
Wicked Witch of the West," by Gregory Maguire, a revisionist history of Oz focusing on the Witch: her 
family background, her biography (including her name), her motives, and the political situation of Oz, 
including the explanation of just why the Wizard wanted her dead to begin with.</p>

<p>Having checked all this several times to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything, I threw on my long, 
dark gray trenchcoat, and left the hotel (rattling slightly as I went) for the Tube station connecting 
for the train south out of London...toward Carol.</p>

<p>The train from London to Horsham took slightly over an hour. I kept a close eye on my roses, making 
sure they weren't crushed by people getting on or off, and ran down a list of questions to ask in my 
mind. I was representing all fifty members of the Society, and I wasn't about to let them down if I 
could possibly help it.</p>

<p>The train arrived in Horsham about 5:30 pm. It was raining very lightly, and the train station was 
unheated, so I decided to go down to the theater early. When I arrived, I introduced myself to Rachael 
Mayne, the front-of-house manager, who welcomed me in a very friendly manner, explaining that Carol 
was still at the pre-show meal, but would be with me shortly. I talked to her for a few minutes about 
the Society and the website, giving her the address; she showed me into the lobby to wait, and then 
left me to my thoughts.</p>

<p>If I didn't pace a track into Rachael's beautiful carpet, it wasn't for lack of trying. I looked at 
the art on the theater walls, but I didn't really see it. My heart was pounding, my mouth was dry, 
and my mind was trying to impose calm on my nerves. Suddenly, from behind me, I heard, "Erik?" in a 
soft transatlantic accent. I turned around and... there She was.</p></font>
