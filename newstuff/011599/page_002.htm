<br>I noticed right away that She'd slimmed down considerably since her Python days. Her hair is 
still a soft strawberry-blonde with no trace of gray, but in a very different style: a shorter, 
straight bob, in bangs over her forehead, and curled at the ends. Her eyes are huge and blue, eyes 
you could drown in. We hugged (I'll never dryclean that sportcoat again), I thanked Her profusely for 
meeting me, and She asked, "Well, would you like to come upstairs?" I said, "I've been waiting for 
you to ask me that question for <i>years!</i>" She smiled, and we went upstairs for... coffee. (What did 
you expect? She'd only just met me!)

<p>Upstairs, I presented Her with the gifts I'd brought: the book, the roses, and the best emails asking 
to join the Society. Over coffee, we started by talking about PythOnline and the Castle. She thought 
PythOnline had shuffled off this mortal coil, but I reassured Her that to the best of my knowledge, 
it was still not quite dead. <img width=231 height=288 src="carol.jpg" align=right>It was someone from PythOnline, She said, that had first told Her about 
the existence of the Castle, only about six months ago! When that person said to Her, very excitedly, 
"You've got a website!" She replied, "Is that good? Is that bad? Should I see a doctor?" But despite 
admitting to being computer illiterate, She <i>has</i> seen it (most recently about three months ago), and 
is "very flattered and honored" to have both the Society and the Castle established in Her honor. In 
fact, She drops the existence of both into casual conversation with new acquaintances! She has not,
 however, seen either of PythOnline's special tributes to Her. We must rectify that somehow.</p>

<p>I then asked Her the question that everyone in the Society's dying to know: Her status regarding the 
Python 30th-anniversary reunion. She said that still nothing had been "signed, sealed and delivered" 
by now, and that they were still trying to decide just what they wanted to do. Of the various ideas, 
She said that Her favorite would be a live concert in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Of Her Python experiences, Her favorite were the Hollywood Bowl concerts, where they had "8000 fans 
all mouthing the words." They had fun with the fans, though, by slightly changing the script and the 
timing, throwing them all off. The Bowl concerts did lead to some confusion among the Pythons: at 
this time, the custom of "woofing" to show appreciation was just starting in America, and all of the 
Pythons were completely flummoxed, not knowing whether the audience was showing appreciation or 
disdain! "Have we got 8000 Texans out there?" Carol wondered at one point.</p>

<p>Then I asked Her the other question on behalf of the Society: whether She had any trips to America 
coming up. The answer, sadly, was no. In fact, She had no upcoming engagements anywhere booked at the 
time.</p>

<p>We were now beginning to run short on time, so I quickly took a few pictures, and attempted to record 
an audio greeting to Her fans. Disaster struck: although the first 20 seconds of Her greeting were 
fine, the tape recorder then sped up, making the rest of it sound like the Chipmunks. I tried a second 
time; the second take was completely unusable. Although my recorder mangled many of Her irreplaceable, 
ad-libbed words, She did express Her sincere gratitude to all in the Society for their support, and 
wished you could all be there to watch Her perform. Finally, before excusing Herself to get into 
costume, makeup, and character, She invited me back to Her dressing room after the show.</p>

<p>Despite what I'd expected, the show was not a traditional British pantomime at all, with its audience 
participation, heroes played by young girls, middle-aged women played by men, and so on. Instead, it 
was a faithful adaptation for the stage, of the 1900 book and 1939 MGM musical. As is traditional, 
Carol played a double role: Miss Gulch, Dorothy's nemesis in Kansas, and the Wicked Witch.</p>

<p>Her costume as Miss Gulch was a severe black suit with a skirt, a flat-topped black hat, and a black 
neckerchief with white stripes. She made Her first entrance pedaling an ancient-looking bicycle, also 
black. As the Witch, She wore the traditional large black hat (but with the point folded over, instead of 
sticking up in the air), a flowing gray wig, a long dress with an ankle-length flowing skirt, stockings, 
and high heels, all black, of course. Her makeup as the Witch was the traditional green, with black 
around her eyes, lips, and down the sides of Her nose. As the Witch, She delivered Her lines with a 
very effective, strident voice, rising to a very witchy screeching cackle in moments of emphasis. Her 
voice was hoarse after both performances when we met in Her dressing room, but did that stop Her? Not 
a bit, Carol fans. What a trouper! Most of Her lines were delivered near top volume, with a fine, 
over-the-top, scenery-chewing ardor which fitted the character very well indeed. (She needed to be 
loud, to be heard over the audience's ritual booing!) Needless to say, I was the only person <i>not</i> 
cheering when that little twit Dorothy melted Her.</p>

<p>At the end of the show, when She came out to take Her bow, I rose to my feet for a loyal standing 
ovation. And She looked right at me...and thumbed Her nose! Never before has a nose-thumbing filled 
me with such pride.</p>

<p>After the show, Rachael led me back to Her dressing room (the door of which was marked with the 
traditional star), knocked, and showed me in. She was still in makeup and costume, but no longer in 
character, and I was able to get a few "after" pictures of Her. Two items were prominent on and above 
Her dressing table: a long line of holiday cards sent by Her various admirers (including me), and an 
excellent studio photo of Her with Her late mother, Pat. The resemblance between mother and daughter 
was striking, and the source of Carol's enduring good looks was very obvious. She poured a glass of 
port for me, and one for Herself. As we sipped, I mentioned that I'd just seen "Annie: a Royal 
Adventure" on video. She said that Pat had been *very* upset with that film, seeing her "beautiful 
little girl" playing such an ugly, evil frump as Miss Hannigan, but that She enjoyed playing the part. 
I also asked her about "Are You Being Served?" which She'd also enjoyed, despite being violently ill 
the day before taping, and mentioned that her "Avengers" episode will soon be available on video in 
the US. She was pleased to hear this, as She still earns royalties from it. So, Carol fans, buy a 
copy of "A Touch of Brimstone" when it comes out in April, and help support Her!</p>

<p>Also, somewhere in the middle of this conversation, She paid me the ultimate compliment one could 
give a librarian or other researcher: "You probably know more about my career than I do!"</p>
