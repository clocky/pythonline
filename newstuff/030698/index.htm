<p>The U.S. Comedy Arts Festival gets under way this weekend in Aspen! The remaining five Pythons will be in 
attendance, as well as our very own dear JeannaOnline, who will no doubt be gleaning as much torrid 
gossip and explicit photography as she can from the event. Stay tuned to this frequency... we'll be 
posting material as soon as we have it available!</p>
