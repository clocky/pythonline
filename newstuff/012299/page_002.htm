<br><center><h2>My Audiences with Carol</h2>
<h3>by Erik D. Larsen<br>
Part II</h3></center>

<p>(Pythonettes' note: Here, as promised, is the second part of Eric's account of his audience 
with Carol Cleveland. You can also find more information on Her Carolness at <a href="http://come.to/castlecleveland/">The Castle Cleveland.</a>)</p>

<p>December 30, 1998 (continued)<img width=231 height=288 src="carol.jpg" align=right></p>

<p>After about fifteen minutes, She was out of makeup and ready to change into civilian clothes, so 
it was time for me to leave for the night. We made arrangements to meet at the Black Jug, a local 
pub, before tomorrow's matinee... and then, Carol friends... She came up to me and kissed me lightly 
on my left cheek! I floated out of the theater, my mind full of soft fluffy pink clouds and little 
twittering birdies, and up the hill to the railway station for the trip back to London. All the way 
back, as I frantically scribbled notes to capture all I could of this unforgettable night, I could 
feel the imprint of Her lips on my cheek...</p>

<p>Dec. 31, 1999: "My (First) Lunch With Carol"</p>

<p>I had lunch today at the Black Jug, with John Radford (my local contact, and friend of Carol's) 
and his family. While we waited for Carol to arrive, I took the opportunity to present him with a 
splendidly calligraphed certificate, which I'd had specially commissioned. This certificate, signed 
by Carol and myself, officially named him the second Honorary Member of the CCA&J-TS, in appreciation 
of his facilitation of my trip. John was suitably impressed, and promised to have the certificate 
framed and hung in a place of honor in his new home.</p>

<p>Carol arrived about 12:15, Her voice hoarse from the witchy cackling and screeching. Of course, She 
didn't feel like talking too much, having to save Her voice for the matinee, but She did chat a bit. 
Somebody asked Her how long it took to put on the witch makeup; She said that as the run of the play 
went on, it took Her less and less time, until She could now do it in about six minutes.</p>

<p>So, not too much significant Carol-info today, as She wasn't completely well. But if I hadn't known 
She had a sore throat, I never would have guessed it from Her performances. There were understudies 
for all the major parts in the play, except for the Witch - it was Carol or nobody!</p>

<p>John asked me to do a short interview by phone on the New Year's day edition of his program, "Breakfast 
Live," heard on the BBC's Southern Counties service. Unfortunately, as you can tell from the title, 
it's an early-morning show, and I was planning a late night in Trafalgar Square. Still, if Carol could 
go on and knock Her pipes out, even with a sore throat, there's no reason I couldn't talk about Carol 
at 8:45 am on New Year's Day, even with a hangover.</p>

<p>Although Carol was unable to receive me in Her dressing room after tonight's show, because of other 
commitments, I sat through the second performance and enjoyed that as much as the first.</p>

<p>January 1, 1999: "Start Spreading the News"</p>

<p>The phone call from John's producer came around 8:40 am, as promised. Despite having seen the New 
Year in from Trafalgar Square, and as a consequence not getting back to the hotel until about 1:45 in 
the morning, I was remarkably lucid (if I say so myself). We spoke for about five minutes, on the 
improbable origins and history of the Society and the Castle. He finished by asking me what I thought 
of Carol, now we'd met. I poured on the praise, saying that She was friendly, funny, great to be with, 
and that I recommended Her to everybody. Maybe not the best choice of words, but given that I was 
still a bit jet-lagged and short of sleep, I think I did reasonably well. John was gracious enough to 
record the show for me, so that may find its way onto the website later. No other Carol-related 
activity took place today.</p>

<p>January 2, 1999: "Good News and Bad News"</p>

<p>Carol called me at my hotel this morning, at about 10 am, with the news that She'd been asked to 
audition on Tuesday, January 5th, for a new play. Unfortunately, that meant that we wouldn't be able 
to meet in Brighton on the 4th, as we'd originally planned. I was disappointed, as I was planning to 
show Her the new developments on the site on that day. In lieu of that, however, She asked me to lunch 
before the final show tomorrow, and also invited me to meet Her again before the show tonight. She 
said that She'd also bring Peter, the new man in Her life, along to lunch.</p>

<p>Once again, I took the train down to Horsham, and met Her upstairs at the theater. I immediately asked 
about Her audition: it was for a brand-new musical, playing an Off-West End (the British equivalent 
of Off-Broadway) theater. It's a custom among actors not to mention too much information about possible 
upcoming roles, for fear of bad luck, so She said no more, and I didn't press (much). She did, 
however, promise to keep me posted. We also talked a bit about "Pom-Poms Up," her one-woman show. 
Although She enjoyed doing it, both at the Brighton Festival and aboard the QE2, She still felt 
proprietary towards it, so didn't want to put lyrics to it on the Castle. (Sorry, Carol fans - I 
tried!)</p>

<p>I'd purchased another tape recorder by this time, and so I made a third attempt to record an audio 
greeting to her fans. I explained that sound takes up massive amounts of computer memory, but She 
just kept on talking, not that I minded at all. "I'm a chatterbox," She said. Luckily, the third take 
was perfect (although it may need just a touch of editing).</p>

<p>Carol was still a little hoarse today, so we kept the chat brief, talking about travel and jet lag. 
She told me that on a trip to Australia, with a twelve-hour time difference from the UK, She'd been 
fine within 24 hours on the trip out, but had suffered from jet lag for almost <i>three weeks</i> on the 
way back!</p>

<p>During the show, I tried recording some of Her dialogue, but because of the acoustics of the theater, 
I doubt whether any of it will be usable. During the cast bows, I also tried getting a few photos, 
with no flash, using fast film and available light.</p>

<p>Again, because of other commitments, She was unable to meet me after the show. So, after the show, I 
left the theater right away for the trip back to London, wondering what the man lucky enough to share 
Her life would be like.</p></font>
