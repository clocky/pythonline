<br>January 3, 1999: "Hail and Farewell"

<p>Carol met me at the Black Jug at about 12:15. She was wearing a short skirt today, and I couldn't 
help but notice that Her legs were still beautiful. With Her was Peter Lonfeldt, the man in Her 
life - a handsome bloke, just under six feet tall with brownish-blond hair and a short beard, about 
Her age. By profession, he's a wine importer, originally from Denmark but now living in England. 
Carol introduced us, we shook hands, and I let him know in no uncertain terms what a lucky man he 
was.</p>

<p>We all sat down and ordered. I asked how Her throat was holding up, and expressed concern about having 
enough voice left for the upcoming audition. But She said everything would be all right. We discussed 
musicals and auditions, and I reminded Her that, as a music librarian, I'd be more than happy to look 
for any song She needed but couldn't find. I even offered to copy them illegally and send the copies 
along: "For you, Carol," I said, "I'm prepared to flout the copyright laws of the United States of 
America. In fact, I fart in their general direction!" She chuckled and said, "What a man!" in the 
same half-serious, half-mocking tone in which She'd once complained about never having had jockstraps 
thrown at Her.</p>

<p>Then we all picked up and moved to another table, as our first location was drafty. As we settled in, 
Carol asked me to tell Her a bit about myself, so I did, mentioning my hobbies, work, interests, 
where I lived, and my second job as an amateur sports official. She looked completely surprised when 
I mentioned that I occasionally work as an amateur boxing referee - the look on Her face was 
priceless! I also mentioned my championship run on "Jeopardy!" and She was very impressed.</p>

<p>The talk then turned to my family, and I mentioned that they all lived in different cities in Texas. 
Carol told me a bit about Her own years in Texas: She lived in San Antonio for a few years, starting 
at the age of seven. Her fellow schoolgirls were fascinated by Her mother Pat's British accent, and 
would drop over to their house just to hear Pat talk. And, to fit in with the other girls at school, 
Carol began to adopt a Texas accent, or as She put it, "Ah began t'tawk lahk thiyus!" in a perfect 
Texas drawl! Now it was my turn to be surprised! So Carol can do at least three accents: Texas, 
general American (which she picked up due to living in America for years as a young girl) and her 
normal "transatlantic" accent, about halfway between a British and an American accent. In fact, She 
has dual US and British citizenship.</p>

<p>And then, Carol fans, She dropped the biggest bit of news of my whole visit: She and Peter are 
thinking of leaving England for a warmer climate! California's at the top of Her list, followed by 
Australia and South Africa. She's leaning toward California because there, with Her dual UK/US 
citizenship, She could legally work anytime, in contrast to the legal hurdles She'd face in Australia. 
The work rules in South Africa would be more lenient, but She was concerned (and rightly so, I think) 
about Her personal safety there. I tried to convince Her to come to California, saying that if She 
did, I was sure that the local Society members would gladly sign up for bodyguard duty.</p>

<p>By this time, it was getting late, and Carol had to report to the theater for the half-hour call. But 
She invited me back to Her dressing room again, for a quick farewell after the show. She left, and 
Peter and I talked among ourselves for a few minutes before leaving for the theater. He struck me as 
being friendly yet reserved, nowhere near as outgoing as Carol.</p>

<p>At the theater, I sat attentively, trying my hardest to impress the details of the very last 
performance on my mind. I tried recording a bit more of Carol's dialogue, but again the sound as 
captured by my recorder wasn't good at all. During the intermission, I saw Rachael again: she told me 
that the show had been a big success at the box office, with 85% of the seats sold over the duration 
of its run. It had also been very favorably reviewed in the local paper. At the end of the show, I 
again stood when Carol took her bow, and was rewarded with another nose-thumbing. (She actually did 
that at every show, but this time, again, She looked right at me.)</p>

<p>After the show, Peter and I went backstage together. Carol arrived a few minutes later, still in 
makeup and costume. She posed for two more pictures with me, and then two with Peter. I hope the 
flash bouncing off my glasses didn't ruin the pictures! Then She gave me three gifts I'll always 
treasure: a copy of her latest head shot, inscribed and autographed; a poster from the show, 
inscribed by Her and a few of the other players; and Her very own rehearsal script. Carol was 
supposed to have returned it, but told the person who came for it that She'd already thrown it away 
- just so She could give it to me. I feel tremendously flattered, but also very humbled and grateful, 
that She would have done something like that for me.</p>

<p>After a few more moments, She said that She had to get changed for the cast party, and so I knew it 
was time to say goodbye. I thanked Her again profusely for everything. She hugged me and kissed my 
cheek again, and I managed to give Her a peck on the cheek as well. I left Her sitting at Her 
dressing table, removing the witch makeup.</p>

<p>Peter had stepped out, and as I was leaving, I met him on the stairs. I swallowed hard, and said 
something which, although I meant it sincerely, was very difficult for me to say: that I wished them 
both many years of happiness together. Then, with my cheek still tingling from Her last kiss, I 
walked back through the light rain, carefully guarding Her presents, back up the hill toward the 
train station for London.</p>

<p>It was only on the train that I realized there was a bit of Carol's makeup on my cheek, and I could 
also feel and taste it on my lips. Then it came to me: I, a mortal man, had kissed and been kissed by 
a witch, and <i>hadn't</i> turned into a newt! How lucky I was, and indeed how lucky to have had these 
encounters with Carol over these past few days! It's my most sincere wish that all of you in the 
Society may also have the pleasure of meeting Her in person someday.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>This concludes my special report to the Society. I can now tell you all from personal experience that 
Carol is definitely a very special lady: friendly, gracious, funny, absolutely wonderful to be with, 
and that She went very far out of Her way to make me feel welcome. I cannot state strongly enough 
that She is, by all means, completely deserving of our continued, unalloyed adoration.</p>
