<h2>Deconstructing Disney</h2>
<p><font size=+1><b><i>Hollywood explained. Number 79: Jeffery Katzenburg.</i></b></p></center>

<p>Working conditions are very hard at Disney. Tough overseers crack down on the poor slaves who are 
building elaborate monuments; long hours are worked, no one is paid. Prince Jeffery is found as a 
young babe floating in the rushes from Paramount. He is adopted by Disney at the executive level, 
ignorant of his true background. He works side by side with Rameses (Eisner) the man who becomes 
Pharaoh in charge of all the Land of Disney, with almost godlike powers. One day Prince Jeffery finds 
his true people (writers and artists). He is not really an executive after all. He will lead the 
writers and artists out of the bondage of the Land of Burbank. "Let my people go" says Jeffery, but 
despite several warnings Pharaoh Eisner ignores him. So Prince Jeffery is forced to take extreme 
measures. Finally Pharaoh relents , but even when he is leaving Eisner attempts to prevent him with a 
chariot charge of lawyers, who are all drowned. Prince Jeffery makes his escape from Disney and leads 
his people into the promised wetland. Here they can all Dream and work together. In the final frames 
Prince Jeffery comes down from the mountain with the script for his next animated movie carved in 
rock. The Ten Deal Points. Everyone is at his feet. There is no Pharaoh above him. He has finally 
found himself. He is home.</p>
