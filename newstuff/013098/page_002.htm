<br><font size=+1>We're once again putting out an all points bulletin for your help! The Pythons will 
be getting together again (well, the remaining five, anyway) for the Aspen Comedy Festival on March 4th through the 8th. Since it will be filmed by HBO, we've been asked by Eric and the people who 
run the event if we could come up with some questions that those of you out there have REALLY been 
wanting to ask. (BTW: The question 'Boxers or Briefs' has already been taken!)

<p>As extra incentive, we will offer a few prizes for the best questions (sorry, no tickets - the event 
is sold out). We'll need your input within the next week or two - time enough to put together something 
really great!</p>

<p>Please e-mail your questions to <a href="mailto:jcrawford@la.7thlevel.com">JeannaOnline</a> or post them on the <a href="http://www.pythonline.com/chitchat/chat/messageboard/askpython/index.htm">APO board.</a></p>

<p>Thank you!<br>
