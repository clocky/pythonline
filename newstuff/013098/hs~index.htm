<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Jan 22 (Reuters) - Astronaut Andrew Thomas plans to survive the isolation of 

a four-month stay on Russia's Mir space station with the help of <i>"Monty Python's Complete Waste of 

Time"</i> CD-ROM. Thomas describes the computer program as "the ideal piece of entertainment for a flight 

on Mir." His psychological survival gear also includes the music of Beethoven, Bach and The Beatles, 

a small library of books and fresh strings for Mir's guitar.</p>



<p>"Entertainment and recreation are very important in a flight like this because of the confinement," 

Thomas said. "You have to somehow psychologically get away from what you're doing, and at times the 

people you're with. You have to have a lot of resources."</p>



<p>The 46-year-old aerospace engineer took off for Mir on Thursday night aboard the space shuttle 

Endeavour and will become the seventh and final U.S. astronaut to live and work aboard the Russian 

space outpost. He will take the place of David Wolf, who has lived aboard the station since September. 

Thomas, who was born in Australia and gained U.S. citizenship in 1986, was not supposed to fly to Mir. 

He was a backup to Wolf and moved into the prime position in August when Wolf took the place of 

another astronaut who was deemed too short to fit a Russian space suit.</p>



<p>"My role was originally as a backup with a very low likelihood of flying, and then the world changed 

very dramatically for me in a big way," he said. Spacewalk training had to be crammed into Thomas' 

schedule after NASA decided its astronauts had to be ready for emergency spacewalks. Thomas said the 

training program at Russia's Star City cosmonaut base was "one of the toughest things I've ever done."</p>



<p>Learning Russian was also a major challenge. Thomas admits he is not fluent in the language, but says 

he knows enough for basic conversations. The space station's troubles last year, including a fire and 

an orbital collision, do not faze Thomas.</p>



<p>"I think there could be times where the basic creature comforts are not quite ideal, but I don't see 

that there's profound safety issues," he said. "It's not going to come tumbling out of the sky, as 

I've seen in some greatly exaggerated press reports.</p>



<p>"There was some concern from family and friends - parents particularly - concerning riding on Mir, 

but I don't think they have those concerns now. We've had a lot of talks about it."</p>



<p>Thomas will be the seventh and final NASA astronaut to live aboard Mir as part of a three-year effort 

designed to pave the way for start of the International Space station project later this year.</p>
