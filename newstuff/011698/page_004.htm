At last I read her, and see why so many people recommend her. Her prose is quite
simply wonderful, her tale simple and powerful. About the settlers in America and
their struggles to survive in the harsh winters of the mid west, after long treks
from Bohemia. No sentimentality but plenty of sentiment.</font>

The best book I have read for ages, and certainly the best book on Mathematics I
have ever read. He makes understanding the world of mathematics accessible to the
non-mathematician. I really loved the whole book, the shape, the intrigue, the history... fascinating.</font></p>

A portrait of Hollywood in the 1940's. Fascinating. Very well written history of
this strange town, the German exiles, the Jewish leaders, the scandals, the vandals
and the deaths of stars... Very enjoyable.</font></p>

Oh what a master he is. A chance to re-read my favorite TV play &quot;Professional
Foul.&quot; Amazing how he manages to tie in a demonstration and a discussion of
ethics with professional football. He is the genius de nos jours.</font></p>

A wonderful thought provoking book. Essays on creation and the artist, with special
