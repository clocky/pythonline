One of my favourite books of the year. History of the close of the Medieval era and
the Renaissance. Clearly, concisely written for the general reader. All the Popes
and their nastiness. Very good indeed.</font>

A beautiful book about Manet's great classic painting, the model who sat for it,
the appalled reception it received, and the group of Impressionists (Monet, Renoir,
Pissaro) and their Parisian world which was utterly changed by the foolish Franco-Prussian
war with Bismarck, which caused the fall of Louis Napoleon and the awful suffering
of the winter siege of Paris by the Prussians, and the artists who fought against
them.</font></p>

A novel in the form of a memoir. (Isn't this where the year started with <I>My Other
Life?</I>) He cleverly names all names but his own. His narrator is fictional, and
murdered by Andrew Cunanan. Everything else works but this last. His gossipy expose
of the rich and trivial and their obsession (shared with the world) at the monstrous
farce of the O.J. trial is highly readable, and highly delightful. He writes deceptively
well.</font></p>
