Well I'm no Oprah, but encouraged by your enthusiastic response to last year, here is a quick 
selection of my favorite books of the year. I think my top hits are the Paul Theroux, the William 
Manchester, and the wonderful book on Fermat's Last Theorem, but everything that has been included 
was enjoyed by me, though not all were published this year. So good luck to you all, and good 
reading and if you don't like the book, just put it down. There is so much else to read!

<p>Best Wishes,<br>
