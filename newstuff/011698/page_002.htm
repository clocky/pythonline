<FONT SIZE="3">&quot;There is no such thing as a novel anymore...What has already
taken its place? The work that is nearer to autobiography or memoir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="4">This is the leitmotif of this wonderful book and this fictional memoir
is probably closer to the truth of his life than any autobiography. It calls itself
a Novel yet the novelist Paul Theroux is central to the tale, wandering through reminiscences
of his life in the wake of a failed marriage. (Nomadism in modern novelists - discuss!)
He is remarkably good on the female, especially the predatory female (Lady Max, Wanda
Fagan, the rich wife of the American entrepreneur who wants poetry lessons, even
the Queen.) It is full of rich ripe writing, with instantly memorable scenes. Funny,
touching, haunting, he gets better and better. I doubt I'll enjoy a book more this
year.</font>

The diary of a retiring actor and modest genius. He writes well of his life. I do
hope he doesn't destroy his diary as he threatens here to do - I suspect they are
a good deal cattier and bitchier than this and he seems anxious to avoid offense,
which makes him a good man. Fifties men and Catholicism - discuss with particular
reference to Guinness and Greene. Perhaps it is the need for authority and categorical
imperatives that makes their generation so in love with either Marxism or Papacy.
We live in shiftier times - and have the nomads Chatwin and Theroux. You are nowhere
nowadays unless you are going somewhere.</font></p>

Six months on the set with Marilyn and Olivier by another naughty son of Lord Clark.
Very indiscreet memoirs of the film acting world from a 3rd A.D's point of view.
A rather tight-arsed Olivier and the completely maddening world of Marilyn. Very
funny.</font></p>
