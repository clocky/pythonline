Oh rare one. A Czech collector of Meissen prefers to maintain his own cabinet of
wonders rather than leave the East, and his revenge on the predatory state waiting
for him to die. (He smashes it all.) Exquisite.</font>

A very funny send up of post modernism and American English Departments by a practitioner.
Skewers political correctness and I actually preferred him to Randall Jarrell's <I>Pictures
from an Institution.</I></font></p>

Part Three of his epic and wonderful translation of Homer's Iliad. It gets better
and better. I can't wait for more. Truly great.</font></p>

The History of the Yorks and the Lancs and the incessant gang warfare that devastated
England and Scotland. How young they all were, and how many of them died. If you
picked the wrong side you'd had it. Much insight into the Fifteenth century and facts
I was woefully ignorant of - for example King Edward IV was King twice - once deposed
then returned. Richard IIIrd, so young, and so violent. Shakespeare was not so far
out this history affirms.</font></p>

A wonderful book, set in Savannah and beautifully written. Purportedly a true story,
a writer settles in to the South for a look around. The indolent pace quickens as
one character becomes involved in the murder of another. Many quirky and unforgettable
characters, (a black drag queen called Chablis for instance) including a very funny
scene at the trial of the freeloading Joe Odom. Rather wonderful and a classic.</font></p>

Beautiful French novel of WW1, and a kind of who-dun-it tale of shot deserters, pushed
out into No Man's Land by the French army.</font></p>

A wonderful post Vietnam war novel about a survivor stalked by a determined killer
and victim. The clash between the banal world of the bread company, the failure of
his marriage, and the increasing boldness of his stalker leads to a fine tension,
which does not quite finally succeed at the end. But a great read.</font></p>
