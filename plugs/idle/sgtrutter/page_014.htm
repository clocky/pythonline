			<p><font size=+1>It was a fun project, the most fun perhaps I ever had 
			filming. I like to think I invented the "mock documentary" form, remember 
			this was before <i>Zelig</i> and before <i>Spinal Tap.</i> I'm glad to see it has a 
			continuing life, I will always remain proud of the work and as George says 
			in his big leather job: 'What should have happened is that the Bonzo and the 
			Beatles should have turned into one great Rutle band with all the Pythons 
			and had a laugh...The Rutles told the story so much better than the usual 
			boring documentary. Try and see that film. That is a recommendation rather 
			like saying: 'Don't bother me - see my lawyer. He will explain everything.'</p>

			<p>I watched the Beatles Anthology last night. I had been avoiding it. After all 
			I practically majored in Beatlemania, and for a short time read and watched 
			everything I could on the Fabs. There was some new old footage even I hadn't 
			seen, but all in all I felt we did a pretty good job. There was nothing new 
			to add to The Rutles story. It was made in a time of innocence, before the 
			appalling murder of John Lennon. George repeated a lot of the stories he had 
			told me (the reefer in Buck House, the nightmare in Manila etc.) and came up 
			with a great new line - "Everybody used us as an excuse to go mad." It's 
			partly true and partly disingenuous. They did after all encourage us! It's 
			amazing watching "the actual" history to see just how much our lives were 
			bound up with the Beatle story. Almost every major beat of my post teenage 
			years is to the beat of a Beatles song. But I think I am most proud of the 
			way the Rutles story has slid invidiously into the real story of the Beatles. 
			To hear George saying "we had a couple of cups of tea before meeting Elvis" 
			and know he is slyly referring to the Rutles is for me very satisfying. Almost 
			as satisfying as finding that Elvis referred to everyone as "Squire" from 
			my Nudge Nudge sketch. But that's another story...</p>
