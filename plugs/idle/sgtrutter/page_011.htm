			<p><font size=+1>It was a time of fun, magical madness and confusion and all 
			too soon the five weeks were over. We said farewell to Neil Innes who had 
			been masterfully playing Nasty, his role of a lifetime, and Gary and I began 
			cutting the movie. Eventually we took the film off to New York. I felt it 
			still lacked something: a big performance, so I hastily wrote a scene for 
			Belushi as Alan Klein. He was filming Going South with Jack Nicholson, as 
			well as doing Saturday Night Live and lots else, so we got him for about half 
			an hour on no sleep whatsoever. He did it in two takes. I sketched in a nice 
			scene for Gilda Radnor, which we shot in the village and Bill Murray 
			improvised madly as Murray the "K." Finally we shot Danny Ackroyd in the 
			bowery loft where I had lived and written the Rutles. He played the poor sod 
			who 'passed' on the Rutles. "What's it like to be such an asshole?" I asked 
			him. This was the only line NBC would cut, though we put it in the longer 
			British version.</p>    

			<p>We flew to New Orleans to film a very bad pun by the Banks of the Mississippi 
			(the First National, the Chase Manhattan...) and some of the stuff about the 
			black roots of Rutle music where we were fortunate to find very talented local 
			actors. "He's lyin'... he's always lyin'." I was reluctantly persuaded that it 
			would be a very bad idea to film a Ku Klux Klan gag in white sheets in New 
			Orleans. One difference about British and American humor is that Brits don't 
			shoot you. I was persuaded that it would be better for my life if we didn't 
			do the shot. I saw the sense in this.</p></font>
