			<p><font size=+1>I flew out to California to stay with George and Olivia in 
			LA, showing a rough cut to both him and Derek Taylor who was now a VP at 
			Warner records. Derek was an enormous supporter of the project and by an 
			amazing co-incidence Warner Brothers picked up the proposed Rutles album, 
			unloading it gently from a puzzled Clive Davis at Arista, who really didn't 
			know what to make of all this Ruttling. Derek gave us a huge artwork budget 
			for a ten page pictorial spread on the Rutles, which Basil Pao helped me 
			assemble in a white hot fury in ten days in New York. This album is worth a 
			lot of money today if you happen to have one. Derek also produced an endless 
			stream of promotional postcards, one with genuine material stuck on saying 
			"I think it was the trousers." Meanwhile we were ready for a Preview. Aviva 
			Slessen had been editing the film, trying to find a balance between two 
			directors and eventually we wound up editing the show on video because it was 
			quicker, because parts of the movie were shot on video anyway and because the 
			whole thing would only ever be for television. (There was never a finished 
			film print of the Rutles, though some enterprising Australians duped one from 
			a bootleg video and distributed it as a movie round Australia. I tried to sue 
			but apparently theft is quite legal down unda.) Reminds me of the first time 
			I visited Australia, when a burly Immigration Officer came up to me and said 
			"Do you have a criminal record?" To which I replied "Good heavens I had no 
			idea one was still required."</p>

			<p>The first Preview we showed in a crammed cutting room high above Times Square. 
			We invited a small crowd including Bobbie Zarem, the publicist, and Lorne 
			Michaels, the executive Producer and various other friends who all stared at the 
			tiny screen on the Steinbeck and seemed to have a good time. At the end of the 
			screening we got them to turn round and look out of the window at the huge 
			color TV screen in Times Square. They turned round in amazement to see Times 
			Square lit up with the words "THE RUTLES ARE COMING!" Good timing that, and 
			worth the last of our precious budget.</p></font>
