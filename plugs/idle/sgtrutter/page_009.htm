			<p><font size=+1>A budget was approved. NBC said yes. Filming dates were set. 
			Neil Innes was hired to compose a dozen new Beatles tracks and we were in 
			business once again back in New York to meet with Gary Weis and discuss the 
			script and casting. I interviewed Paul Simon in his elegant Central Park South 
			apartment about the influence of the Rutles on his life and music. He played 
			along beautifully, ad-libbing about the Rutles influence on him and his 
			memories of them at the time. I then interviewed Mick Jagger at his house. 
			"How shall I play it?" asked Mick, somewhat nervously. "Just act Mick Jagger," 
			I said. "Oh, right okay," he said and popping straight into character as the 
			naughty Mick he revealed perhaps more than was discreet of his memories - a 
			Stones-eye view of the Beatles. Confident we actually had some usable 
			footage in the can, I returned to London. Neil was hard at work producing 
			mock Beatle songs. Craig Kellum the producer came over and we began casting 
			and seeing how much we could squeeze out of our small budget. Rather 
			reluctantly I went into hospital for an appendix removal. Ten days later, 
			after a very jolly visit with George Harrison at Friar Park, celebrating my 
			new appendix-free life with champagne and curry, I was rushed back into 
			intensive care, green in the face and palely loitering. Craig Kellum's face 
			was a mask of panic as I got him to witness my will before the ambulance 
			took me off to the intensive care unit at the Wellington Hospital.</p>   

			<p>An unpleasant night or two later and I was feeling much better. Paul Simon 
			had called me as I was recovering and I told him I was like a big gas balloon 
			waiting to explode. I said "If only I could pass wind I might begin to come 
			back to life." "Helping people fart is a service I happen to provide," said 
			Paul and that did it. I started to laugh. I laughed so hard I started to fart. 
			It was loud, long and deep, like a huge balloon emptying. It lasted for almost 
			two minutes. It was so loud that Tania became hysterical. People popped their 
			heads in to see what was wrong. They saw a loudly farting Brit beating the 
			bed in total hysterics. When it was over I thanked Paul profusely. "I have 
			had many thanks in my life, but that's a first for me. Glad to be of use," 
			he said.</p></font>
