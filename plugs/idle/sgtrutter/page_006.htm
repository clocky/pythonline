			<p><font size=+1>Later when the Christmas festivities were over and the New 
			Yorkers returned to their cold climate I moved into the Paladian pile next 
			door and stayed on and on for weeks playing guitar everyday. No meat was ever 
			taken, so I became by default a rather healthy fishatarian. The villa was 
			rented by an endlessly philanthropic gentleman called "Baron" who seemed to 
			do nothing much except take sporadic meetings with strange gentlemen from 
			South America. He would then cycle round the island for hours at great speed.
			Occasionally, swarthy mustachioed cowboy "chopper pilots" would be introduced 
			at dinner, as if ex-Vietnam vets passing through Barbados on mysterious 
			missions were the most natural dining companions in the world. Rikki and I 
			studiously avoided inquiring too deeply into the nature of these business deals 
			being content to swallow endless rum-punches provided by an ancient Butler 
			improbably called "Mr. Brown" who'd once served drinks to Winston Churchill.
			Mr. Brown's thoughts on the nature of serving another round of rum punches to 
			two long haired guitar playing hippies were mercifully hidden from us and we 
			would sit and play in the exquisite gardens of this fine reproduction Paladian 
			villa (built by Ronnie Tree in 1946) and wonder where exactly our host came 
			up with the half million dollars cash he reportedly had plunked down to buy 
			it. Odd too to think that only a year later this same Mr. Brown would be 
			serving run punches to John Cleese and Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Graham 
			Chapman, Keith Moon and Terry Gilliam, since we rented the Villa for two weeks 
			to rewrite <i>The Life of Brian.</i></p>

			<p>"It's all set," Lorne Michaels said on the phone, "we need to talk," and my 
			six week West Indian idyll was at an end. 'All good things must come to an 
			end,' I thought as I waved farewell to my friends at Heron Bay and climbed into 
			the taxi that would take me to meet my future wife in New York that very same 
			day. I had stopped eating meat and I had stopped serial dating. I was as 
			healthy and clear-sighted and relaxed as I have ever been.</font><br>
