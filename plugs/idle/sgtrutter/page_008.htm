			<p><font size=+1>Tania went off to work every morning leaving me laboring away 
			writing with the huge German Shepherd called "Snark", directly under the Carol 
			Conway Dance Studio where the floor would bounce for hours to the sounds of 
			"AND one, and two, and three and four..." I plundered the book shops for more 
			Beatle photographs, read every memoir I could lay my hands on, cut and pasted 
			and parodied and after about a month or so of intensive travail I finally had 
			a script I felt worked. Gary Weis was set to co-direct with me, and I was 
			pleased about this as I had previously made two short films with him for 
			Saturday Night Live. The first I wrote was "Drag Racing" - Dan Aykroyd and 
			me in full drag racing along a tiny air strip in Flushing- the second, was 
			"Body Language" a short piece I'm still proud of. For some reason - to do 
			with budgets and Writers Guild requirements, which Lorne carefully explained 
			to me, I wasn't allowed to be actually credited or paid for these pieces. 
			Never mind, they were fun to shoot and on the show they played gangbusters.</p>

			<p>February passed pleasantly in the joy of a new love affair and a new project, 
			and soon it was time to fly to New Orleans for Mardi Gras where Lorne was 
			improbably attempting to perform Saturday Night Live from the streets of 
			Carnival on a Sunday in Prime Time, an insanely ambitious project which almost 
			ended in disaster. It confirmed NBC's suspicions that they were not at all 
			ready for Prime Time, and indeed Lorne was lucky to escape without severe 
			retribution. NBC were however very pleased with the Rutles script which was 
			now called All You Need is Cash and it was time to go and budget the shoot.</p>  

			<p>After the madness of Carnival I flew back to England tearing myself briefly 
			away from the lovely Tania; (but sending her a ticket the minute I landed in 
			London.) Life would no longer be possible without her. When she arrived in 
			London I drove her around pointing out all the wrong places "That's Buckingham 
			Palace" I would say pointing to the Houses of Parliament. "Over there is the 
			Post Office Tower" as I pointed to Big Ben: she's been confused ever since.</p></font>
