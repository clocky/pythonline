			<font size=+1>Flash forward later in the year and we are filming somewhere 
			in Shepherds Bush, in the mean little back streets behind the BBC. We are set 
			to shoot this gag. I am wearing a silly wig (as usual) hiding my shoulder 
			length hair. Our cameraman has done lots of documentaries and he knows exactly 
			the way the gag should work. The first take works fine. "From these streets" 
			I begin walking slowly with the camera "very near the Cavern Rutland" - the 
			camera car increases speed and I am forced to increase my pace to keep up with 
			it, "Dirk, Nasty, Stig and Barry, the legendary pre-fab Four, the legendary 
			Rutles.." the camera pulls away, I break into a run. I end up hurtling down 
			the street yelling at full speed whilst the camera-car disappears round the 
			corner. We do it again a couple of times but I know we've got it first take. 
			It seemed really funny running up the street after a fast disappearing film 
			crew. I had a strange little memory of my Provencal hideaway.

			<p>A few days later we are down in Shepperton Studios filming <i>I Must Be in 
			Love</i> the song Neil had sent me, only now we are dressed as sixties Beatles and 
			it has become a song from <i>A Hard Days Rut</i>. It's November, it's freezing, 
			it's intermittently raining and we are making up sight gags in a field that 
			has been a housing estate for almost twenty years now. Neil is Nasty, David 
			Batley is Dirk, I am shaking a leg as George (Stig) and John Halsey is the 
			lovable Barry.</p></font>
