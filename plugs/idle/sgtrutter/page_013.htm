			<p><font size=+1>Bobbie Zarem was so knocked out with the viewing that he 
			gave it to his good friend Frank Rich, Time Magazine's then TV critic who went 
			out of his way to savagely tear it apart the next week immediately before we 
			aired. It only required NBC then to schedule us in Prime Time opposite the 
			enormously popular <i>Charlie's Angels</i> to ensure that when we aired we were 
			absolutely buried in the ratings. The late night repeat however, a few months 
			later fared a lot better and when the show went to England, it was such a 
			smash hit at Easter that they repeated it a month later. In the end we had 
			decided to do two cuts. The British version ran longer by about ten minutes 
			and contained the "asshole" joke and a film called "You need feet" a parody 
			of Yoko's "bottoms" film.</p> 

			<p>People always ask 'how did the Beatles react?' Well George was behind it all 
			the way but the first time I played him the music he got slightly upset and 
			started to sing "Instant Karma gonna get you!" in a very loud voice. It 
			certainly did, since ATV music ended up grabbing all the copyright. But after 
			this slight hiccup he loved the show and was very proud of it. He had 
			supported me all the way, encouraging me to do it, telling me endless Beatle 
			stories and even showing me <i>The Long and Winding Road,</i> an Apple cut of 
			the documentary footage of the Beatles which none of them could agree to 
			release. This Neil Aspinall film eventually became the basis for the recently 
			released Beatles Anthology, but for a long time my movie existed as a strange 
			parody of a film no one had ever seen.</p>

			<p>Ringo liked the Rutles "after 1968" he added mysteriously. Paul was a little 
			strange about it, somewhat guarded when we met, though Linda loved it and went 
			on about it. Paul seemed to approve finally only when he learned that I had 
			grown up in Wallasey opposite Liverpool. "Hey Linda, it's okay, he's a Scouse, 
			he's one of us!" John and Yoko I heard through the grapevine absolutely adored 
			it which I thought was very sporting of them especially as Yoko is portrayed 
			as Hitler's daughter but then she has a very great sense of humor as I found 
			out when I made a speech at a Bowie wedding many years later.</p></font>
