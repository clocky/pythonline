			<p><font size=+1>The bit cuts together like a dream and it is one of my 
			favorite pieces from the entire series so when I'm invited to host Saturday 
			Night Live in October 1976 and Lorne Michaels asks to run something from my 
			series I show him the Rutles clip and one other piece, a parody of The Who's 
			<i>Tommy</i> called <i>Pommy,</i> which is about a deaf, dumb and blind man stuck in a Ken 
			Russell film and his struggles to get out of the cinema.</p>

			<p>It's a nice bit in which I run around as a rather whacky Roger Daltry, 
			eventually running straight into camera and being impaled by it. (You'll 
			notice I was heavy into camera gags that year.) Lorne selects the Rutles 
			piece. On the show it gets a huge laugh and a great audience reaction to the 
			song and the sight of the Rutles. After the show there is a surprisingly 
			strong response, many fans begging for more and writing into the show sending 
			letters to the Rutles. I'm gratified to hear this because encouraged by 
			George (the former Beatle) I've been thinking that this might make a nice 
			documentary special. I mention to Lorne that I'm thinking of doing this for 
			BBC TV. "Don't do that," he says, "do it for me through my deal with NBC, 
			you'll have a much bigger budget." Now you should realize that Rutland 
			Weekend TV as well as being about the world's smallest TV station was also 
			done on the world's smallest TV budget. The entire first series of six cost 
			only thirty thousand pounds, and was filmed in the world's smallest TV studio 
			(on the fourth floor opposite the weather studio). We could hardly afford 
			sets. Everything had to be brought up one at a time in a large lift. Our 
			only advantage was since there was no room for an audience we could tape and 
			shoot at will. The artistic joys of having no budget which I foolishly 
			associated with independence and thrift were beginning to wear off. "Come 
			and meet me for Christmas in Barbados and we'll talk about it," said Lorne 
			jovially on the trans-Atlantic phone.</p></font>
