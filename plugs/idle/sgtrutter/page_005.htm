			<p><font size=+1>Now the idea of leaving rainy, miserable, November London 
			for a spell in Barbados in 1976 was a very attractive proposition. My 
			marriage had broken up the year before and the beautiful teenage Australian 
			model I was dating was making mating noises, bringing in 'HIS and HERS' 
			cushions to my house and leaving large hints that she should move in with me 
			and begin the important task of re-arranging the furniture. Since this thought 
			induced panic attacks and interfered with my serial dating plans, it was 
			clearly time to move on. I accepted Lorne Michael's invitation to join him, 
			his girlfriend Susan, Paul Simon and Shelly Duval (an improbable couple then 
			and now) at the Barrier Reef Hotel in St. James Barbados. My word it was 
			tough. I could tell you about days of lounging in the sun, hours wasted 
			plunging into the sea, decades spent playing guitars all day, drinking rum 
			punch, dancing by night, visiting extraordinary parties where the young, 
			famous, gifted and fat rubbed shoulders with some of the shapeliest shoulders 
			on the planet. It was a really tough life but someone has to do it.</p></font>

			<font size=+1>One day, I took a walk along the beach in St. James, and met a strange, tall, 
			dark-skinned gentleman sitting cross-legged on the beach gazing at the sea.  
			"I'm Rikki," he said. So Stig entered my life, under the guise of Rikki 
			Fataar, a most unlikely attractive fellow who had been a twelve year old rock 
			star drummer in South Africa at the age of twelve with The Flames, passed 
			through swinging London en route to joining the Beach boys. Several tours 
			and a wife later he was, like me, in transition.</font>
