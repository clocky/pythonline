			<p><font size=+1>It is only very rarely when writing comedy that you actually 
			make yourself laugh out loud. It happened to me just once. I can remember 
			precisely where I was the moment I thought of the Rutles. It was early summer 
			in the Var, a most beautiful part of Southern France where I had a tiny house. 
			A short walk from the three roomed tiled-roof house, nestling in a few acres 
			of terraced olives, was an even smaller four square white-washed cabanon with 
			a slanted roof in the old Provencal manner and a single glass-paneled door 
			which served as a window letting in light. In the doorway I had installed a 
			small rough wooden table where I perched on a Van Gogh straw chair and wrote 
			in pencil in large French ring-leafed exercise books. My task (and indeed 
			pleasure) was writing sketches, songs and film pieces for my very own TV 
			series Rutland Weekend Television and the books piling up in front of me were 
			filled with tea stained jottings and ideas for various skits and film bits.</p> 

			<p>I had dragged Neil Innes into the project and his job was to provide one 
			or two songs per week. I would then fit them into sketches or link them or 
			come up with film ideas. To this end he sent me demo tapes of his work while 
			I wrote the rest of the material. Many of his songs were "Beatley," hardly 
			surprising since the hit he wrote for the Bonzo Dog Band "I'm The Urban 
			Spacemen" was produced by Paul McCartney. One of the songs sounded so very 
			like the Beatles of "A Hard Days Night" era that it came to me in a flash: 
			we should do it as The Rutles, and at the same time I got this gag of a TV 
			interviewer walking and talking to camera and the camera moving just slightly 
			faster away from him so that he has to hurry, then break into a run and finally 
			ends up galloping after the camera which eventually leaves him behind. This 
			image made me howl with laughter. I just knew it was funny. I stood outside 
			the cabanon and laughed and laughed. Provence in all its olive, lavender, 
			thyme and fennel-filled air carried on being Provence. Birds twittered, bees 
			buzzed and huge improbable butterflies wobbled through the scented air. Taking 
			a fresh lungful I went back inside and in one fell swoop wrote the speech the 
			narrator would say.</p></font>
