			<p><font size=+1>I had lost a lot of weight in the hospital but it would 
			prove useful filming the youthful Dirk McQuickly. Neil was meanwhile bashing 
			out Rutles songs in a small barge on the Regent's Canal. I was in no shape 
			to join him. I was swamped with all the preparations for shooting. I was 
			co-directing, I was making last minute script changes, I was down to play 
			four parts and there was still no sign of Gary Weis my co-director. In any 
			case Neil made it clear he was keen to have an actual band which he could 
			rehearse and bash into shape so he invited his friend Ollie Halsall to play 
			and sing the Dirk vocal part. Together with John Halsey and Rikki Fataar they 
			were forming a good tight sounding group. I cast Ollie as "Leppo" the fifth 
			Rutle so he would at least get to appear. Still sore from the Operation and 
			its unpleasant aftermath, I was happy to finally welcome my co-Director Gary 
			Weis to town. We had only three weeks to go. Somehow we made it. We shot for 
			five weeks in London and Liverpool. It was great fun dressing up as Beatles 
			being chased around by young girls. Gary and I slipped swiftly into a 
			comfortable co-directing relationship, he operated the camera and I stood in 
			front of it yammering away as the incompetent interviewer and it all worked 
			remarkably well. I cast Tania in four different roles to save money, one as 
			a hooker outside the Rats Keller in the Rieperbahn bar, one as the bikini 
			girl lying beside Stanley J. Krammerhead III (the airhead Professor from 
			California), one as a Rutles merchandise model and she also appears as a 
			fetching Gypsy hippie in "Love Life". Highlights of the filming were 
			shooting "Ouch" on the sands of Southport, on the sand dunes where I had 
			played as a kid and where the sun came out and shone so very perfectly as we 
			were trying to fake the West Indies. The then Mrs. Jagger, (Bianca) came up 
			to play Dirk's wife "Martini" (my first screen kiss) and we ad-libbed happily 
			in the garden of poet Roger McGough. Ronnie Wood played a Hell's Angel, 
			Roger McGough played Roger McGough and George Harrison played an interviewer 
			interviewing Michael Palin playing Derek Taylor. One day outside Abbey Road 
			studios (just by the legendary crossing) Neil and I were dressed as the 
			Beatles, me as Paul and Neil as the full Lennon in beard and white outfit. 
			That day George was visiting. He was talking to us when he was roughly pushed 
			aside and almost flattened by a breathless tourist anxious to ask us if we 
			were really the Beatles. He totally ignored the real Beatle!</p></font>
