			<p><font size=+1>Barbados - 86 degrees. New York - 6 degrees. Lorne had 
			thoughtfully provided a limo and a heavy overcoat to meet me at the airport. 
			I went directly to Saturday Night Live where I watched Fran Tarkington host 
			the show, then on to a party full of long legged models whom I studiously 
			avoided (I was through that stage I told myself) and finally downtown in a 
			big white limo to Danny Ackroyd's loft where a rowdy post show gathering was 
			in full swing. After an hour or so Lorne and Paul and the others left for 
			uptown but for some reason I stayed on. The party was still jumping. I had 
			been away from bright lights and big cities for months. I was tanned, fit, 
			blond, long haired and healthy. As I leaned quietly against the kitchen sink 
			a tall dark haired girl came over to me, smiled and asked me to dance and I 
			instantly fell head over heels in love.  We went outside and necked on the 
			stairs and it took me a while to persuade her how convinced I was that we 
			were supposed to be together. I have never been so convinced of anything 
			in my life. Fortunately she believed me because that's twenty years ago last 
			week and we've been together every moment since.</p> 

			<p>A few days later when I managed to resurface, with a smile on my face and a 
			lovely lady on my arm, Lorne commissioned me to write a 15 page treatment of 
			The Rutles story. I bought every picture book I could find of the Beatles, 
			cut them all to bits and pasted them into a rough shape. I then bashed out 
			the treatment in a white hot fury and sent it in liberally illustrated. To 
			our delight NBC immediately okayed it. I was commissioned by them to write a 
			full screen play. I moved into the loft on Bond St. in the Bowery which 
			Tania shared with Danny Ackroyd and Mike Pahios (a graphic artist for NBC) 
			and an enormous German Shepherd. It was freezing outside but the Sauna was 
			on day and night and since it had no door the heat escaping from it stoked 
			the apartment as warm as Barbados. When I queried the expense someone told 
			me the apartment's electricity was "accidentally" hooked up to the Budget 
			Rent-A Car down stairs, so they never had any electricity bills. Lucky really.</p></font>
