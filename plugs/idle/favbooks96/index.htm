			<p><font size=+1>For many of you who like to read I thought I'd give you a selection of my favorite 
			books of 1996. These are the books I most enjoyed last year, though not all of them were 
			newly published in the year. Hope you enjoy them.</font></p>

			<p><font size=+2><b>Napoleon and Josephine</b></font><br>
			<font size=+1><b><i>Evangeline Bruce</i></b><br>
			My book of the year. A wonderfully descriptive social history of France through the 
			Revolution and the Empire. Sadly this was her only book but it is fabulous, the sort of 
			book you dread finishing. History has never been so alive, or the shit Napoleon so 
			brilliantly skewered. He is like a little mob chieftain from Sicily. Thoroughly recommended.</font>

			<p><font size=+2><b>Putting On The Ritz</b></font><br>
			<font size=+1><b><i>Joe Keenan</i></b><br>
			Hilarious. The funniest book I read all year. This beautifully written comedy about two 
			New York men and their female friend,  who become involved in chaotic infighting between 
			two rich feuding publishers -  one clearly the Donald (Trump) and the other a seventy year 
			old  Malcolm Forbes. There are many truly funny set pieces and inspired dialogue. I sent 
			this to several friends and I recommend you rush out and read it.</font>

			<p><font size=+2><b>What Am I Doing Here?</b></font><br>
			<font size=+1><b><i>Bruce Chatwin</i></b><br>
			Wonderful travel pieces. He writes so well. What a great writer.</font>

			<p><font size=+2><b>Coming Through Slaughter</b></font><br>
			<font size=+1><b><i>Michael Ondaatje</i></b><br>
			I love the way he writes. This is the story of Buddy Bolden, a New Orleans jazz trumpeter 
			who went nuts while playing in New Orleans. Beautifully written, almost like a scenario, 
			he brings everything to life. Those who have only read <b><i>The English Patient</i></b> may well enjoy 
			reading more of this wonderful writer.</font>
