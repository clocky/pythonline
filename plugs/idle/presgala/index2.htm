<P>It’s a tough life if you don’t weaken.   Last night I sat behind President and Mrs. Clinton at a Gala Hollywood evening, attended by some of the richest and most powerful people in the town who had clubbed together to donate $4 million dollars to have dinner and watch a concert featuring the Eagles, Chicago, Tom Scott, the Neville Brothers and Barbra Streisand.  If the price of democracy is high, the price of Democrats seems even higher.  Demosthenes would be turning in his grave, like a kebab.
