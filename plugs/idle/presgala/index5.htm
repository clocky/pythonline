So having been asked by Bob Dole to represent the Republicans in my area how come I am now practically pushed into the arms of the Clintons,  I hear you ask?  Well, this is evidently <a href="../../gilliam/chaos/page2.htm">Chaos Theory</a> in action.  If in a month’s time I am reporting to you from the Perot camp you will know that there is much more than blind chance at work here.  Of course sitting behind US Presidents at a Theatrical event may be considered historically   just the job for a Limey.  It is after all a dangerous seat, directly in the line of fire, as the big black burly secret service man pressed against my thigh testified.  How wonderfully ironic that I could bounce and jig and shake my legs to the wonderful Neville brothers while he had to remain ramrod stiff and unflinching.  Sometimes, as Barry Cryer once said, life is very well written.  But what was I doing there?
