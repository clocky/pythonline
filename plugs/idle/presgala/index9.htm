Thanks to everyone who tuned in to my grilling in the AOL Oldsmobile Forum - if you missed it you can catch highlights under Plugs and <a href="/plugs/idle">Idlewild</a>.

<P>Rutles fans will be pleased to learn that VH1 has licensed "All you need is Cash" for two years.  Sadly, Martin Lewis is still alive.

<P>Next week we have a great piece from Michael Palin reporting from the set of Fierce Creatures - and some upcoming stuff from Terry Jones and A.Toad.  You should be aware we update stuff every Friday so check us out regularly or we'll piss off.
