<P>Well I have a friend, well more of a God really, who shelled out an awful lot for those seats - man we are talking six figures here - and that’s a lot.   But his movie director wouldn’t let him go.  There you have it.  His President wanted him at his table, but his Director would not release him!  (If the Director finds his Tax Returns heavily scrutinized this year I for one wouldn’t blame Bill Clinton.)  So Tania and I were called in to pinch hit for him.  We weren’t doing anything that evening so we thought - well why not?  Having faced the traffic snarl and the protesters - we tried to smile nicely and maintain an air of ironic detachment while a man in a Mouse suit protested the devastation of the wetlands - through the security - (no worse than an airport) and in to the Harold Lloyd mansion - now owned by a wholesale grocer - and when I say mansion I mean Hotel.  In fact in England some towns are smaller than this.
