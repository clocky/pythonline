<P>If you set your bookmarks for the Home Page you'll miss the new material we put in every week.  So, if you have somehow missed Terry Gilliam's <a href="/fakeopen/9-13/page2.htm">Chaos Theory</a> then you should come in and start again.    

<P>We had a message from Terry Gilliam this week:
<BR>"p.s. I want to get info on the site re:  the September release of the Brazil Laserdisc + info on the fact that 12 Monkeys has been top of the video charts for 4-5 weeks.  How do I reach the editorial staff?"
<BR>P.S.  Terry - I am the editorial staff.  Just e-mail me.

<P>Congratulations on 12 Monkeys (which will be on sale in our Shop from 4th October) and good luck with Criterion's release of Brazil.  But when oh when are we going to see the Sid Sheinberg cut?
