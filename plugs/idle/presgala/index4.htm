<P>Now I know this is expecting a lot of you to believe, but we had no idea that’s where we’d be.  We were like a couple of innocent out of towners who suddenly found ourselves centre stage.   As the President came in glowing with health and goodwill, and took his seat in front of us I found myself marveling how any one could cope with such pressures.  While he tapped his feet to the Neville Brothers, and declined gracefully to play saxophone with Chicago, was he really wondering how many Stealth Bombers to send to Kuwait, just how many Cruise Missiles to drop on Saddam Hussein.  This is truly scary shit.  The man in charge of the Western world has to schmooze the crowd, and duck for dollars, and continue with politics as usual, and run for office, and still run the world.  All I can tell you is that Bill and Hilary wife truly seemed to have a great time.  They looked like they were on a great date.  They glowed with health and vitality.
