<P>So what the hell was your humble correspondent doing there, decked out in a smart suit sitting for two hours within arms reach of Hillary and William Jefferson Clinton, cheek by jowl with a couple of burly security guards on seats marked Secret Service in huge letters (not much of a secret really.)  What was I doing with the first couple watching them as they laughed at Tom Hanks, watching them hug each other (really) to the Eagles, watching your President wipe away a real tear as Barbra Streisand sang with thirty young kids, hearing  your President say "Oh it’s Tom" as my pal Tom Scott came on to play.  I am not making this up.  My wife and I felt like Cinderella for a night.   We had to pinch ourselves we were really there.  I could reach out and touch both of them.   Of course I couldn’t really as the muscles of the man pressed next to me testified, but I have to tell you this was impressive proximity to the seat (or seats) of power.  As we looked around at people who had shelled out thousands of dollars to be there, people who glanced wonderingly at us, wondering why the hell WE were there, we could only smile nicely and graciously and bask in the knowledge that sometimes life (like God) moves in a mysterious way.  Karmically we were there because we didn’t give a buck.
