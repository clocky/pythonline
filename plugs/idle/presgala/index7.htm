Tania and I were alerted by the red of our tickets that maybe something was a bit special.  The audience was laid out in rows on the grass on those little event chairs that appear at weddings.  We were walked towards the front, we sat down centre stage - oh good seats we thought, no problem about hearing the Eagles from here.  Suddenly my wife gave a little gasp and clutched me.  She was staring wide eyed at the seats just in front.  On them were labels which read The President and Mrs. Clinton.
