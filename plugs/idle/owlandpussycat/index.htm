     The Owl and the Pussycat, illustrated by Edward Lear. (1846)

 Here in a shameless attempt to induce you to order the book,
the author writes about his admiration for Edward Lear and his
art.<BR>

<H1>Edward Lear and his art.</H1>

<P>
 Most people first encounter Edward Lear through his limericks
and nonsense poems.   What makes them so peculiar are the wonderfully
strange characters with which he illustrates them.    I find I
am enchanted by the creatures he creates.  This for example is
his drawing of the Yonghy-Bhongy Bo.<BR>

<P>
But who could resist &quot;The Scroobius Snake, who always wore
a Hat on his Head for fear he should bite anybody?&quot;<img SRC="img00003.gif">
<P>
or the &quot;Bountiful Beetle, who always carried a Green Umbrella
when it didn't rain, and left it at home when it did.&quot;<img SRC="img00004.gif">

 I was familiar with this quirky illustrator side of Lear, since
I once made a bathtub out of tiles a friend made from these drawings,
but it was some surprise to me when about fifteen years ago the
Royal Academy held a retrospective of his paintings.   Here were
massive Victorian landscapes of great beauty and detail, a world
away from his pen and ink illustrations.  I was fortunate enough
to be guided round this exhibition by the erudite George Melly,
himself no stranger to nonsense. 
<P>
        <img SRC="img00005.gif"> <BR>
<img SRC="img00006.gif"> Lear was a quaint old bird who began
by painting brilliantly detailed pictures of birds (his owls are
spectacular) and for a short while he even instructed  Queen Victoria
in painting.

He spent most of his life abroad, traveling extensively on painting
tours through the Balkans and the Middle East.    He was obscure
and poor and would probably have remained so but for the publication
of <I>A Book of Nonsense </I>in 1846 which was an overnight sensation.
<img SRC="img00007.gif"> <BR>

<P>
This collection of limericks, and children's poems and nonsense
pictures became a best seller (and has ever since remained so.)
  In this collection was the famous poem The Owl and the Pussycat.

 In 1993 John Du Prez and I were casting around for a subject
for an animated musical.  We had written two musicals together,
one of which (<I>Behind The Crease)</I> had been produced on BBC
 Radio.  One day I found myself reciting to my daughter Lily the
poem of The Owl and The Pussycat.   Like most children she fell
under the spell of its charm.   I realized that its fabulous combination
of love story, adventure and happy resolution would make a great
musical subject. <img SRC="img00009.gif">
<P>
   John and I began by writing some songs.   I like to do this
in a new project since when you get stuck on the writing the songs
can inspire you and encourage you to continue.    So we sat in
an old stone cabin in Provence, John with his keyboard and me
with guitar and bashed out about twenty songs,       
<P>
            <img SRC="img00010.gif">which we stuck in some kind
of order on battered cork boards.  I then began the writing task.
 This continued off and on for three years.

Since in the beginning we were writing a musical animated film
we were working on a three act structure.   The poem itself  begins
bang at the start of Act Two with Owl and Pussycat running away
to sea.   There is no explanation of who they are or how they
meet (a bird and a cat??) or why they do such a bizarre thing
as putting to sea with only some honey and plenty of money wrapped
up in a five pound note.   This left Act One very much open. 
  It was my job to construct the back story, to create a reason
for them to sail for a year and a day to the land where the Bong
Tree grows.      
<P>

At first I wrote a very Dickensian opening with a timorous Owl,
recently orphaned by the death of his Uncle, sent off to an unpleasant
boarding school called Old Wolves Hall, where a voracious Mr.
Wolf and his unpleasant wife Virginia cowed the boys until Owl
stood up to him defied him and ran away to sea.  There was something
about a Pirate chest in the attic and a sinister Captain Cat returning
looking for his map to find &quot;the land where the Bong Tree
grows.&quot;    This was all too obviously a lift from Treasure
Island combined with Nicholas Nickelby and though much of this
early plot was written we abandoned it (or it abandoned we.)

For a while we suffered the disadvantages of encouragement from
a Major Studio, which entailed receiving notes from an Executive
(who we will call Ann Executive in order to spare his blushes.)
  Often such notes are the writers equivalent of an enema, they
induce shit, and after a few frustrating months of attempting
to satisfy the whims of Ann Executive John Du Prez carefully reminded
me that he was talking through his fundament, and not even paying
for the privilege, and we sailed off into the wonderful waters
of the State of Development.     <BR>

I had a pleasant meeting with a Mr. Steven Spielberg, who listened
politely to my pitch (with a streaming cold) and kindly declined
because he said &quot;Animations with animal leads don't make
money.&quot;   I was encouraged to discover that even the greatest
of names can be mistaken when <I>The Lion King</I> opened a few
weeks later!    He then cast me as Dibbs in <I>Casper</I> to prevent
my writing anything further&#133;

But I am not easily dissuaded by sense and John Du Prez kept digging,
prodding and encouraging me and gradually a shape began to emerge.
  I was constantly inspired by Lear himself, there are some wonderfully
silly prose pieces as well as the Nonsense poems and I particularly
enjoyed his silly botanical drawings.    Who for example could
resist a botanist who created this plant?<img SRC="img00015.gif">I
love the way Lear deals with these plants as though they were
real, even down to the Latin names.   This for example he calls
The Many Peeplia Upsidedownia .   Or how about the strangely apt
<P>
Piggy-wiggia.<img SRC="img00016.gif">Or a flower which grows guitars?<img SRC="img00017.gif">
<BR>

<P>
All these themes (guitars, pigs, owls and cats) are in the Owl
and Pussycat poem, and helped me slowly construct a story through
the hints and clues Lear left.  Names of places. Lake Pipple-popple
and The City of Tosh I found in his admirable prose writings.
 Some of his drawings I simply had to include in the story.  
 This walking fish is irresistible.<img SRC="img00018.gif">
<P>
Or how about the wonderfully snooty Ostrich with its kinky boots?<img SRC="img00019.gif">
<BR>

<P>
 For me the project really came alive when we put the animated
film idea to one side and decided to create the story as a book.
 Dove Books made us an offer I couldn't refuse (since it involved
no money!) and finally with the assistance of a wonderful illustrator
(Wessla Weller) creating many wonderful line drawings inspired
by Lear we have a book.    <BR>

<P>
I have read the story for Dove Audio and in May John Du Prez and
I recorded fifteen or so songs for this taped version.

    So if
you have kids or know kids, or are renting some kids for a little
while, or you just like Nonsense then I would be happy to send
you a copy of either the book, or the tape, or the special edition
of both if you would prefer.

 copy of the book or the autographed tape of Eric reading (including
the songs) please click on the flower.</I><A href="/shopping/item0208.htm">
