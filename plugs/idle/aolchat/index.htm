<HR>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Hello, the folks of AOL! I'm Jim JMF, your
host for this evening's festivities.<BR>

<P>
<B>OnlineHost:</B>  Eric Idle has been in many films, including
&quot;The Life Of Brian,&quot; &quot;The Holy Grail,&quot; &quot;The
Meaning of Life,&quot; &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,&quot;
&quot;European Vacation,&quot; &quot;Nuns On The Run,&quot; &quot;Splitting
Heirs&quot; (which he also wrote and produced), and most recently
&quot;Casper the Friendly Ghost&quot; for Amblin/Universal. Welcome!
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Everybody, let's give a big welcome to Eric
Idle! Welcome to AOL Live!<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Good evening....<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Are you ready for some questions from the audience?
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  NO. Hang on....I am just fixing my make-up!
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  SLLIM B wants to know:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Mr. Idle, Greetings for a fellow Brit descendent.
I would like to know if you do any personal appearances in the
USA besides the writing and other things?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes...I shall be in New York soon flogging
a book...and maybe on the Tonight Show and so on.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Htencate asks:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric, Please tell us about your new film &quot;Wind
in the Willows.&quot; When will it debut in the United States
and what was it like filming?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  No, it debuts in October in the UK and opens
in January, maybe. It's up to Disney. It was fun filming because
Terry Jones was the director and he was also Mr. Toad and its
fun being directed by a large frog,  now that Truffaut is dead!
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  ChinaD442 ponders about Eric's creative juices:
 
<P>
Question:  So how did you Pythoners come up with your stuff? Any
particular inspirations?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  No. We just stole from each other. I would
steal from John Cleese, he would steal from Terry Gilliam and
Terry Gilliam would steal from Michael Palin, and Graham was always
late.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Pjpw95 has this profound question for Eric:
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Tell me, What is the meaning of life anyway
Eric?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I know the Meaning of Life but I am afraid
it is a secret. <BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  NanLouise has a question about a particular
CD-ROM:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Hi. I made the brutal mistake of buying the
&quot;Complete Waste of Time&quot; CD ROM. Please convince me
why I should ruin my life further by purchasing the brilliant
new release, Holy Grail. Also, Python made me want to become a
writer. Manythanxforchangingmylife.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Don't whatever you do buy &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;
CD-ROM. That's exactly what they want you to do. That's why I
am chained to this radiator at 7th Level.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Htencate asks about the Python web site:  
<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric, how is PythOnline doing so far, in your
opinion? Happy with the results? Any more interesting web activities
in store?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  So far we have over 7 million hits in 7 weeks.
Our highest day was a staggering 258,000 hits. We have almost
20,000 members of the Spam Club and seem to be going great.<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Hello Eric. You are my sister's favorite Python
but Michael Palin is mine. Is there a snail mail address where
I could send him a fan letter? Thanks for your help.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes. You can send him a message at Pythonline...www.pythonline.com.
Or you can always send a letter to Prominent Studios in London,
but the address is a secret.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  ThePreFab asks about Eric's past roles:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Mr. Idle- What is the role that has been the
most fun for you?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Eric Idle.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  KSW JKN asks about Eric's projects:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What are your current or near future projects?
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I have a book published by Dove in October
called the &quot;Quite Remarkable Adventures of the Owl and the
Pussy Cat&quot;. And I am working on a short 3-D Pirate movie
with Leslie Neilson, for Busch Gardens and Seaworld.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  FRSTDEJO asks about Eric's involvement with
the CD-ROM:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Did you have input into your new CD-ROM?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes. I was the executive producer. I went to
lots of meetings and I am afraid I am credited with thinking up
the &quot;Spank the Virgin&quot; game.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Cleo 552 asks about Eric's writing:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How hard was it for you writing on your own
in Python?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I prefer writing on my own. I wrote two sketches
with John Cleese - &quot;The Bruces&quot; and the &quot;Mountaineer&quot;
sketch - and I tried writing with Michael Palin but we both got
too drunk!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  MB Meadow asks about new Python fans:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric:   How do you feel about a new generation
of Python fans adoring you, appreciating your work for the first
time through multi-media and really old, worn out video tapes?
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I feel really good. That's why I am in this
business.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  JMann1730 wants to know:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Will Eric be flogging books in the Boston area
also?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Alas no, but you can buy it through Pythonline.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Rupe33 asks about Eric's book:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric, am curious as to what other Python-related
CD-ROM's thingies may be in the works and please tell us about
your book!<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  My book is based on Edward Lear's poem and
is largely for children. We have plans for more Python CD-ROMs
but I am not allowed to tell you what they are while I am still
chained to the radiator. Our current CD-ROM is the 12th best seller.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Oscuros has a curious question about Spam:
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Is Spam a regular part of your diet, or has
Python tainted the taste of it for you forever?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I am a veggie so I use Spam only as a form
of contraception. You can never get pregnant if you sleep on a
tin of Spam!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  NCarbone poses this question:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Hello Eric! I wanted to ask you if you will
be doing any more Monty Python movies and what exactly does this
CD-ROM contain? Will we be able to 'play this song on the radio'?
  Thank you.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  The CD-ROM is called the &quot;Quest for the
Holy Grail&quot; and the game is just that with lots of little
other games like &quot;Drop Dead&quot;, a puzzle game played with
dead bodies and &quot;Catch the Cow&quot; based on a British disease.
It is extremely unlikely that there will be any more Python movies
because John Cleese is a... oh I'm sorry.... CENSORED!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  BradDP186 asks about a future collaboration:
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric - I have LOVED all your work. Thanks for
the multitude of laughs over the years. Have you and your pal
George Harrison got any future collaborations planned?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  We are still trying to sober up from the past
collaborations. <BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Buterscot asks about Eric's idol:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Who is your favorite idol or inspiration and
why?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Bridgette Bardot, and why not!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  KWBeckers asks about a favorite fellow worker:
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Who was your favorite fellow actor ? John, Michael
or Terry .<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Do you mean an actor, writer or person? John
is great to work with, Michael is the most fun and Terry Jones
is the best director for actors- really helpful.   Terry G. is
the best Movie Director.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Sadie3595 asks about Eric's past characters:
  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric, what Python character did you enjoy playing
most?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Mrs. Hendy. Inside every tall thin male comedian
there is a short fat American woman trying to get out!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Zydryth asks about a past event:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Why weren't you in Comedy Central's Pythonathon
with Terry, Terry, and Michael a few years back?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I was dead at the time. 
<P>
I got better!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  JCurtis12 asks about Python's popularity: 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Are you surprised that Monty Python is still
being aired and still so popular?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes. I am surprised and delighted, stunned
and shocked!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Markfinn asks about Eric's favorite:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What was your favorite role, and why?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I liked the guard in &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;
and I also liked the Jailer in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;. buh
buh buh buh...because...oh dammit!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  DAltFan wonders about Eric's favorite movie:
 <BR>

<P>

of Brian,&quot; &quot;Holy Grail,&quot; or the &quot;Meaning of
Life?&quot;<BR>

<P>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Rupe33 asks:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Eric, hi! Heard friend of yours, the Rutles,
are releasing a new disc. Will there possibly be a new film or
perhaps reunion tour double bill with Spinal Tap? - Kevin in Pittsburgh
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  In Mick Jagger's words...God I hope not!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  RikerJay asks about Eric as a director:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Are you interested in directing if you haven't
already?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I directed Robin Williams in &quot;A Fairy
Tale - The Frog Prince.&quot; And I co-directed &quot;The Rutles&quot;
with Gary Weis.   I like directing actors but I am not obsessive
enough to make it my life.   I prefer writing, where NOBODY gets
between you and the perfection of the page.  <BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  CybLennon has this comparison question:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What do you prefer to work on, British movies
or American movies?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I prefer to work on no movies at all.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Buterscot has a question about reincarnation:
 <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Mr. Idle, if you were reincarnated, what or
who would you come back as?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Cindy Crawford!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Ketra Saj asks, with a smile:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Mr. Idle, do you know how kewl you are?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I'm cruel not kewl, but you have to be cruel
to be funny!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Red Mantl wants to know:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Did you enjoy providing the voice of &quot;Rincewind&quot;
in &quot;Discworld?&quot;<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes, I did and it paid very nicely too. Also,
they let me write and record a song called &quot;That's Death&quot;
which I recorded with Tom Scott.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  SLLIM B wants some hints from Eric:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Mr. Idle, in the credits, it stated that you
had a large part in the computer games(&quot;Waste of Time,&quot;
&quot;Holy Grail&quot;). I have been completely stumped by them.
Bloody good job! Any hints?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I don't understand them at all. My job was
to sit in the meetings, drink ice mochas and make them all laugh.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  ERothmaye has this question:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What did you think of working on &quot;Yellowbeard?&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  It was the best fun I have ever had on a movie.
  The great Peter Cook was inspirational to be with.   Sadly,
after I left my old pal Marty Feldman died.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Raunchgir asks about this:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What characters were you in &quot;Life of Brian&quot;?
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>   Mr. Cheeky, Stan called Loretta, Harry the
Haggler,  Culprit woman who casts the first stone,  Intensely
Dull Youth,  Otto, Jailer's Assistant,  and Mrs. Frisbee the 111rd.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  PenguinIA has this to ask Eric:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Are you still friendly with the other remaining
Pythons?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes. And I have managed to get them all involved
in Pythonline....  Gilliam has done new art, Jones has been writing
some rude stuff, we seized some stuff from John,  Michael has
been scribbling for us and we are preparing to auction off bits
of Graham's ashes which his boyfriend has offered in support.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  F4evrambr poses this for Eric:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How many of the original &quot;Goon Show&quot;
are still alive and working? Please as a transplanted &quot;Brit&quot;
I love to go back and listen to the recordings my Dad has.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Spike is alive and was also in &quot;Brian.&quot;
Harry Secomb is alive and singing hymns on TV for a living. I
hope to follow him soon. The late great Peter Sellers is still
dead.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  WLB009 asks about a past gig:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  I go way back, how did you get to guest host
&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; back in the 70's?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I did it 4 times. The secret was learning how
not to.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Lone Katz asks about the days of the Python
group:   <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Would you say your days of being in the Python
group were embarrassing or fun?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Fun, painful and instructive.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  FractalMo asks about your impact on children:
  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you really realize the impact you have had
on several generations of children?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I deny it, m'lud.  She promised me she was
over 15!<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Drizzt197 asks:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How did you become involved with Discworld and
Rincewind? What can you tell us about Discworld 2?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I sing a song and they asked me to become involved.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  LionessRN has an interesting follow-up:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  If the meaning of life is a secret, how do you
know it?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I was told not to tell you.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Iceshadow asks this interesting question: 
<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  How do we really know you're Eric Eldle?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I'm not Eric Eldle, I am Eric Idle! Eric Eldle
will be on next week with John Close, Michael Plain, and Gray-ham
Champ.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  KSW JKN wonders about a video release:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you know if the letterbox version of Monty
Python and the Holy Grail, with the theatrical trailers, will
be released on video?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  It is. &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; is on Criterion.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  BrianHarg has this comment and question:  
<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Saw a special on PBS about the cast/writers
of Monty Python - very good show - made me realize how much I
miss the show - wanted to know if you would be working on any
projects/movies with any of those original writers/members in
the near future?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Well yes - Pythonline - the very finest interactive
site on the net. Where the Misinformation Highway begins.    Also
most of the ex-Pythons are in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;
with the exception of Terry Gilliam.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Zenmeiste asks about new software:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Are you working on any new software with 7th
Level?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I'm not, but some of the Pythons are going
to if Bob Ezrin, the Deepak Chopra of the interactive world manages
to talk them into it.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  McEel asks about Eric's role:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  What part did you play in The Search for the
Holy Grail?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  The Dead Collector, Mr. Blint (a village ne'er
do well very keen on burning witches), Sir  Robin, the Guard who
doesn't hiccough but tries to get things straight, Concorde (Launcelot's
trusty steed), Roger the Shrubber and Brother Maynard. <BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  MNickell4 asks about how fun it is to do a
show:   <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Was it as much fun to do the show as it is for
us to watch it?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  No.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  PythonMo5 asks this:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Will there be another Python film fest like
two years ago in Hollywood for the &quot;Lust for Glory?&quot;
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Sadly, Martin Lewis who organized this event
is still alive and until he dies we won't come out in public again.
<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  GaViNLvR7 has a profound question:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you often think about the wonders of the
universe, if so is it creation or evolution?<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  It's both, mate. Check my galaxy song. Thanks
for the intelligent question.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Blattm asks about future plans:  <BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I am staying home a lot writing.<BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Do you have any plans for a CD-ROM based on
&quot;Life Of Brian?&quot; The others, &quot;Complete Waste of
Time&quot; etc. were very good.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I have a six year old daughter and it's fun
watching her grow up. Much more fun then being stuck in a trailer
for 18 hours a day.<BR>


<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  The show is drawing to a close, my friends.
But there is enough time for one final question.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  H gargoyl wants to know this:  <BR>

<P>
<B>Question:</B>  Has anyone told you that &quot;The Holy Grail&quot;
makes a great history film? I used it to teach the Middle/Dark
ages. Humor always helps the memory.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Yes. Terry Jones has written a book on medieval
history with a reference to Chaucer's Knight and we always did
research.   For example, they did drop cows and pigs on people.
<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  I would just like to thank 7th Level for doing
such a great job on &quot;The Grail&quot; CD-ROM and Pythonline.
They really are a very silly company to work with and we have
a lot of laughs.<BR>

<P>
<B>AOLiveMC1:</B>  Eric, it's been a real pleasure and honor having
you here on the show with us tonight.<BR>

<P>
<B>EIdleLive:</B>  Piss off!<BR>
