<b><font size=5>Eric Idle writes</b>

<P><Font SIZE=4>
 Eric Idle was the nicest of the six members of Monty Python.
  He was born in the North of England well when I say the nicest
he wasn't absolutely the nicest.  Michael Palin is generally recognised
as being the nicest.   Actually Terry Jones is pretty nice too
and certainly he's very nice at parties.  It's probably fair to
say that he is at least as nice as Michael Palin at parties. 
Come to think of it Terry Gilliam can be fairly nice as well.
 Especially abroad.  In fact he is super nice abroad.  Perhaps
almost too nice.    That Graham Chapman was a nice man and even
John Cleese is a lot nicer than he used to be.   In fact I'd stick
my neck out and  say that nowadays John Cleese is probably amongst
the nicest of them all.   So.

 Eric Idle is the sixth nicest member of the old Monty Python
group.  He was born in the North of England what's so great about
being nice anyway?  Many fine people have lived richly fulfilling
lives without having to worry about being nice.  Nobody said Mozart
was &quot;nice.&quot;   They didn't say &quot;I loved Shakespeare's
Hamlet  but what a nice guy he is.&quot; In fact many great artists
weren't very nice at all.   I forget my point.  
<P>
Oh yes, my point is - so what if I wasn't the nicest? It doesn't
mean I didn't have a lovely life with a wonderful wife and a loving
son and daughter.  It doesn't mean my puppy doesn't love me. 
It doesn't mean I didn't have any friends.   You see.  Actually
I didn't have many friends.  But the friends I did have thought
I was nice.   Well not &quot;nice&quot; nice.  But nice enough
to have as a friend.  I expect.
<P>
Let's just agree to leave the nice thing to one side.  Eric Idle,
while not being necessarily the nicest of the Monty Python group
was born in the North of England during World War Two.  He went
to a not particularly nice boarding school in Wolverhampton from
the age of seven.   That's not going to make you very nice is
it?  He attended Nice College, Cambridge, oh all right Pembroke
College, Cambridge and became President of the Footlights (just
like Peter Cook and no one ever accused him of being nice did
they?  He'd have laughed in their faces if they had.   &quot;Don't
you call me nice you daft old git&quot; he'd have said, in that
funny voice, and he'd have been absolutely right.)

Eric Idle was born in the North of England and etc etc Cambridge.
During the sixties and early seventies he was occasionally mistaken
for Peter Cook.  He now lives in California and is occasionally
mistaken for Gene Wilder.  He is still not particularly nice.
