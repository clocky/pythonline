<FONT SIZE=3>HOW I SLEPT WITH TERRY JONES</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by  A. TOAD<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Contrary to popular misconceptions we members of
the Bufo family - especially those of the Bufo terrestis americanus
branch - enjoy healthy sex-lives and have all read Alex Comfort's
excellent books The Joy of Sex and More Joy of Sex several times
(although the complete failure to relate any of his techniques
to the physique of the average toad is a source of bitter and
abiding disappointment amongst my fellow amphibians). Still, Alex
has done a wonderful job in ridding the world once and for all
of the sort of hang-ups that have bedevilled human sexuality for
so many years, and in helping human beings to appreciate their
sexual drive with the same maturity and frankness that we toads
have enjoyed for the last forty million or so years.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> It was therefore with a certain amount of interest
and excitement that I approached the audition room for the lead
role in The Wind in The Willows. I had heard that it was normal
in these situations to sleep with or provide sexual services to
the Director of any feature film in which one wishes to have a
part, and I had learned that Terry Jones was particularly interested
in 'tail'. This was, of course, a bit of a blow, being, myself,
a rough-skinned, tailless amphibian, however, I reckoned that
if I could once get his trousers unbuttoned I might stand a good
chance of showing Mr. Jones that we toads can more than make up
for the loss of a bit of tail.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> I have to say here that I am not a complete novice
to the audition room or the casting couch. I had already been
up for the part of a police officer in Prime Suspect starring
Helen Mirren, and had only failed to secure the role through pure
genetic prejudice on the part of the director, despite my having
delivered my famous impersonation of Al Jonson swallowing a pork
sword in an underground car-park in Philadelphia. So I was in
no way phased when I was shown into the audition room and found
Mr. Jones, reclining on a chaise lounge and drinking from a bottle
of green chartreuse.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;we're not
auditioning frogs.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Well, as you can imagine, I was furious. &quot;Call
yourself a director? You wart-brained piece of tadpole-snot! I
no more belong to the Ranidae family than you do! Your lead part
is a Toad - well I am a toad!&quot; I yelled at him.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> This appeared to have no effect on Mr. Jones, who
merely rang a little bell at his side and called out &quot;Next!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Realising I had to act fast, if I were to stand
any chance of securing this plum role - a chance that would probably
never come my way again certainly not before next spawning season
- I hurled myself at his fly and managed to get it unbuttoned
just as a lady assistant was entering the room.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;Argggh! Mr. Jones!&quot; she screamed. &quot;What's
that frog doing?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;I'm NOT A FROG!&quot; I managed to yell, but
it was difficult because I now had Terry Jones's half erect penis
firmly in my toothless gums. As I felt the member stiffen I began
to swallow and wrap my tongue around it at the same time. &quot;So
far so good,&quot; I thought. &quot;Just wait until he finds out
what we toads use our 'Bidder's organ'* for!&quot;  But at that
moment I felt myself grabbed from behind by a pair of hands. Well,
I did what any toad has to do in such a situation, I released
 the poison secretion from my parotoid glands.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;Urrrgh!&quot; exclaimed Irene Lamb (I hadn't
realised but this was the fabled casting director herself! Wow!
If I could just get on the right side of her, I realised, my acting
career could really take off in a big way). But at that very moment,
Terry Jones, who was struggling to get his penis out of my throat,
fell backwards over the chaise lounge and struck his head against
a member of Oasis - the number one chart-topping band - who had
been asleep there since the last casting session.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;Shit!&quot; said the member of Oasis. &quot;Why
don't you look where you're falling and for fuck's sake get that
frog off your cock!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;I'M NOT A FROG!&quot; I yelled.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> At the same time Irene Lamb started to scream: &quot;It's
poisoned me!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> &quot;Shit!&quot; I thought. &quot;There goes my
chance of getting a part in the next James Bond film!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Unfortunately in yelling out I had released the
former member of the zany  Monty Python comedy troupe's penis,
and he whipped it out of my gums without so much as a thank you.
At the same time, Irene Lamb threw a towel over me and pulled
me off the chaise lounge and threw me out of  the window. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> I fell for some moments before landing on the head
of the former Director of Social Services for Southwark's grandmother's
dog, which started barking.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> I decided that safety was the most pressing consideration
and I crawled off into some bushes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> I am writing this several days after my attempt
to secure the title role in The Wind in The Willows. I am still
stunned by the tight-arsed prudishness of a film director who
won the Grand prix de la Meilleure Comedie at Vevey, Switzerland
in 1987 with a sleazy film about South London prostitution , and
I am horrified that the Sexual Revolution of the Sixties has either
passed by the so-called film-makers of Britain, or they have never
even bothered to apply it to amphibians.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> For my part, I shall not give up. I was born to
play the role of Toad - it is a travesty of natural justice that
the part should have been awarded to a human - who looks about
as much like a toad as my arse looks like Michael Howard's brain.
What is more the human being who has been awarded the roll turns
out to be none other than the director - he's given it to himself!
My only consolation is that I suppose he sleeps with himself more
than anyone else. Nevertheless I shall be taking my case to the
Court of Justice at the Hague.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3> Yours sincerely<BR>
