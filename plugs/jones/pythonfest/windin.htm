The Chief Weights &amp; Measures Officer for Sofia,
(South-West Section) congratulates the Python team on their latest
offering. 'Nearly as Good as Yellowbeard' opined
the Head of The Tinned Goods (Export Division) of the Bulgarian
Cereals &amp; Grain Products Monopoly (at present living in Majorca). "Terry Gilliam's portrait of a middle-aged Jewish
Rastofarian would have had me rolling in the aisles except for
the fact that everyone was standing in the aisles, owing to a
little-known fire regulation in Bulgarian cinemas which forbids
clients from sitting down during the performance of a film."

Thousands of stars of stage, screen and marketing
co-operatives thronged the densely-packed Cinema Dom in Sofia's
prestigious Ekzarh Yossif Street last Monday night to witness
the World Premiere of Terry Jones's eagerly awaited 'The
Wind In The Willows' - starring Eric Idle as Ratty, Nicol
Williamson as Badger, Terry Jones as Toad and Steve Coogan as
Mole, with guest appearances from John Cleese as Mr Toad's
Defence Counsel and Michael Palin as The Sun.

Cinema Manager Stefan Kitanov posited largest turn-out
for a World Premiere of a Major Western Motion Picture since 'Lassie
Come Home!' (a searing social comment pic spotlighting canine
homelessness and inner city dental decay amongst rodents) was
accidentally opened in Bulgaria prior to being shelved. "It
is a tremendous boost for our plum industry," claimed the
Vice-President of the Balkan Preserved Fruit Marketing Board.

The film was shown with Swedish subtitles, and the
sound was turned off to allow the commentary in Bulgarian and
the playing of festive Bulgairan folk music over the cinema's
loudspeaker system. "We always find our Bulgarian Folk
Dance Tunes fit almost any Hollywood-style sex and violence movies
for children," said the Head of the Red Arrows Display Team.*
<P>
In the month's run-up to the World premiere,
the Cinema Dom had been hosting a month-long Python Fest in which
every single Python movie or related movie had been screened at
least once along with episodes of the TV series. "It has
certainly been a tremendous four weeks in which our damson production
has tripled," claimed The Deputy Chairman of the Balkan
Soft Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association. "We
certainly enjoyed the shows," said the General Manager of
the Rouse Animal Feeds Association.
<P>
Terry arrived in Sofia on 9th June 1996 and returned
to London on the 11th June. "It's a great country,"
he said," and the apricots are some of the best I've
tasted this year."<BR>

*It is not clear what the leader of the Red Arrows
Squadron was doing in Sofia, but he has since opened up a receiving
station for all damaged fruit and disabled vegetables.</FONT>
