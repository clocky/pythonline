So this is Bulgaria! I would hardly have realized that I was in
that fabled land created by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, were
it not for the presence of so many Greek Orthodox priests hiding
under my dining room table. &quot;What are you doing there?&quot;
I try not to sound too threatening, but the harm is done. The
Greek Orthodox priests shriek with fear and lock themselves in
my side-board. I must change my Tyrannosaurus Rex Haircut. The
hairdresser said it was the latest style, but I've been unable
to approach old ladies in the street, or businessmen with a history
of heart by-pass surgery ever since I had it done.
<P>
&quot;It's all right!&quot; I call out to the Greek Orthodox priests
currently cowering in my side-board, &quot;I'm not really a Tyrannosaurus
Rax. It's just this haircut makes me look a bit like one.&quot;
<P>
The side-board door opens and a half-full bottle of sherry is
flung with considerable force towards me, striking me on one of
my dorsal spines. Now this makes me really MAD! With one savage
strike of my immense claw I shatter the sideboard, and the Greek
Orthodox priests scatter like so many maggots from a rotten tree-stump.
With swift strides I give chase, scooping them up in my massive
claws and cramming them into the slavering sabre teeth of my three
foot jaws, tearing their flesh and ripping through their rhasons
(the equivalent of the cassock in the Orthodox Eastern Church)
shredding their epimanikia or liturgical cuffs and puncturing
with each razor sharp talon their epigonations (which is a lozenge-shaped
piece of stiff material about 12 by 10 inches and embroidered,
which hangs at the right side from the shoulders to the knee).
In my feeding frenzy I am deaf to their pleas for mercy and cries
to God. But then that's what being a Carnosaur of the Saurischian
group from the late Cretaceous age is all about.
<P>
When calm has returned to my dining room once more, I look around
for signs of the Welcoming Committee from the British Council,
who are organizing the Monty Python Festival in Sofia. The only
sign of life are a few ants that have crawled in through my kitchen
window. These are no meal for a starving dinosaur of my measurements,but
I scoop them up and pop them into my jaws without thinking.  
<P>
Suddenly a cough makes me spin round. There is someone who could
well be a member of the British Council waving a white handkerchief.
With one simple grab he is gone and I have chewed his mortal remains
and swallowed. Whoever he is is no more. Nothing is a match for
a Tyrannosaurus Rex! I am the King of All Living Carnivores if
only I weren't extinct.
<P>
A few more strides takes me into my living-room. There, lined
up on the mat in front of the mantlepiece is the Manager of the
Kino Dom (the cinema in Sofia where they are running a retrospective
of Monty Python and related films from mid-March to mid-June).
His name is Stefan Kitanov and he is accompanied by several members
of the staff of the Kino Dom, but it is no avail. One of the greek
Orthodox priests as disagreed with me. Perhaps he was off. I have
this terrible ache in my stomach. I roll over, unable to even
reach out and spike Stefan Kitanov with my razor sharp talons.
The pain grows. Another of the Greek Orthodox priests seems to
have gone rancid in my stomach. Arrgh! Never eat Episcopal Vestments
without boiling them first, I remember my mother dinosaur telling
me...but it is too late! The wretched pain grows and I roll about
howling. 
<P>
Suddenly my Hairdresser arrives and shaves my head. Instantly
I come to my senses and realise that I am still miles from Bulgaria
and am still in my home in London.
<P>
My date with destiny at the Kino Dom is not until June 9th. And
best of all I am not extinct! Hooray!
