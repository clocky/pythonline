<TT><FONT SIZE=5> The creative energy behind
'Life of Brian' belongs to vital, teeming, Welsh expatriate TERRY
JONES III. Jones, a rookie brewery owner, has risen quickly to
the top of the motion picture directing tree.<BR>

<TT><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Courier New">Brilliantly gifted at school,
he was a child by the time he was five, and won a place at Britain's
Oxford University while still in his late teens, where he holds
a Master's in Applied Paranoia. Volatile, dominant, highly energized,
svelte, acerbic and coruscating are all words that he uses with
uncertainty. Nevertheless, his dedication, boundless energy and
passionate commitment make it a waste of time to try and change
his mind on anything. Terry Jones III is the kind of man who knows
what he wants and woe betide the man who tries to understand what
he's talking about. Invited to direct 'Life of Brian' Jones III
was forcibly attracted by the script. 'Wow&quot; he says, 'It
was just so neatly typed out in great big pretty orange covers
with punctuation and the pages numbered in the right order and
everything. I just flipped'. Jones, who threw up a promising academic
career only on the advice of his teachers, now devotes his life
to motion pictures. He eats, sleeps and talks film. 'I prefer
it to life,' he confides, his anthracite&#173;coloured eyes flashing,
'the editing facilities are better'. So much so that he has been
shooting a film of his own life for the last seven years. 'When
I have time to edit it,' he claims, 'it should make an interesting
cigarette commercial'. Jones III is married and has two children
that he knows about. <BR>
