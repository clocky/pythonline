<TT><FONT SIZE=5>JOHN CLEESE is not just the most spiritually advanced, intellectually gifted and 
professionally distinguished of the Monty Python group. He is also the one who got landed with 
writing these fucking biographies. Twenty five minutes to midnight, and he's still sitting there, 
poor sod, staring into space, trying to think what he can write about himself, dog tired and he 
hasn't even had time for dinner. So give me a break.</P>

<P>I've got a script conference at nine in the morning. I've got to write an intro to a book by five 
in the afternoon, a press conference at five-thirty and dinner with four of the dullest people in 
Europe after that, and then up at six-thirty the next morning for seven days' filming on the trot. 
So let me off just this once, will you? I really would appreciate it. I'll make myself a cup of 
Horlicks and go straight to bed. Promise. I'm not the sort to give you an excuse like this and then 
nip out after a bit of tail. Honest. 0.K.? Thanks. I really appreciate it.</P>

<P>Mr. Cleese is happily unmarried and is the President of the Holland Park Schadenfreude Society.
