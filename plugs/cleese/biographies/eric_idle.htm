<P>Whether he’s sitting by his caravan, rehearsing in front of
camera, or just getting himself another cup of tea, you can bet
everyone on set is keeping one eye on ERIC "ERIC" IDLE. "You never
know what he's going to do next," explains ‘Life of Brian’ colleague
John Cleese, "one moment he’s reading a newspaper, the next he’ll be
swatting flies with it." Well, there’s a joker in every pack, and the
Python pack, as Kevin Bacall once referred to them, is no exception.
The story goes that during the first week in Tunisia Idle was sitting
in an Arab restaurant one evening, minding his own business, when a
waiter spilled some soup on him. "Before any of us could react,"
recalls Producer John Goldstone, "he just picked up the soup, called
the Manager over, and complained." One of the Pythons recalls the
time when Idle finished a scene and promptly took a nap. "When he
feels like doing something he just goes ahead and does it," laughs
Terry Vance Gilliam shaking his head ruefully.</P>



<P>Word has it that when he’s based in London "Eric" Idle likes
nothing more than to leave his house early some mornings, buy a
newspaper, and read it over breakfast.  "He likes to keep people on
their toes," explains  Director Terry Jones III, "or maybe it’s just
his way of  cocking a snook at the whole crazy world."</P>



<P>Michael "Chunky" Palin, no slouch at clowning himself, remembers
the day at Gabez when "Eric", as they all call him, had two glasses
of milk at lunch.</P>



<P>Why? "Nobody’s quite worked him out," admits former doctor,
ex-medic, previous-physician Graham "Ex-doc" Chapman, "but I think he
just needs to kick over the traces now and again." Adds Director
Jones III, "Once, after filming, he went off for a walk. The trouble
is that if anyone else did something 1ike that, people wouldn’t think
it odd. But "Eric" has got himself a bit of a reputation for oddball
behaviour and so people are sort of looking for it."</P>



<P>And "Eric"? "It’s just a name my mother gave me," explains "Eric",
"and it just somehow stuck." </P>
