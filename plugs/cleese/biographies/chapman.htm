<TT><FONT SIZE=5> Doctor turned leading actor? Yes this is the rags to riches story of GRAHAM CHAPMAN, the boyish ex-medic who forsook forceps for fun and found there was more gold in them thar' Hollywood Hills than there ever was in them thar' pills. A policeman's son, the whacky Chapman majored in medicine before the lure of the dollar prised him from Britain's penniless and collapsing National Health Service. But his expert and expensive medical training was not wasted: it formed the basis for a zany,madcap, off-the-wall TV series featuring a team of whacky girlchasing interns struggling with the appalling problems of treating the desperately ill in an impoverished, crumbling, under-equipped Limey hospital. Next, Britain's funniest ex-doctor won international acclaim for his portrayal of King Arthur in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'. Says tall, blond pipe-smcking former medic Chapman 'That was my big break. From now on it was all 'go' to the very top. But I had to chose my next role carefully'. So carefully that he waited four years. 'Then I saw the script for 'Life of Brian' and Wow" confides lean pharmacologically trained Graham. After a series of exhausting screen tests, one-time-leech Chapman won the role despite fierce competition from Charles Laughton, Leslie Howard and Tyrone Power. 'If this one takes off,' admits quick-witted quandam quack Chapman, 'It could make me rich beyond my wildest dreams. And believe me, my dreams are pretty wild!'. Former fysician Graham may well soon be able to hang up his little black bag and concentrate on his Croesus portrayal, if the word-of-mouth on Python's new block buster is anything to go by.<BR>
