<TT><FONT SIZE=5>The truly exceptional animated sequences in "Life of Brian" spring from the fertile brain of London, 
England-based U.C.L.A. graduate TERRY VANCE GILLIAM. Gilliam came to England just 12 years ago for a bet. 
He's still there, ensconced in his Hampstead, London, England, Europe studio home. A painter, a sculptor, 
a near-professional-standard opera singer, a photo-journalist and a former swimming champion all live nearby.</P>

<P>Some friends call Gilliam a Renaissance man: others place him earlier. The sloping forehead, the forward 
slant of the body as he lopes and the prognathous jaw all point to the Upper Paleolithic period. But whatever 
his physical appearance, his graphics, drawings and paintings are unmistakably Lascaux. And his energy is 
Cromagnon to match.</P>

<P>Left alone with some crates of crayons, some bales of paper and a box or two of fresh fruit, 
his output is nothing short of phenomenal. But Terry Gilliam is not just an illustrator. 
"Yuuurrrrrhhhhhhh," he admits, wryly. "Yuuurrrrrrhhhhhhh." Now that "Life of Brian" is  
safely in the can, Terry is planning to get a typewriter to have a shot at the complete 
works of William Shakespeare.</P>
