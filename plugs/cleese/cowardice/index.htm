First I must thank you because you have done me a great honour.

<P>
I'm afraid all Rectors seem to start by saying something of the
sort.
<P>
In fact only one in recent history appears not to have thanked
those who elected him ; and that was only because he was too busily
engaged on the subject of  'Magnanimity'. And so to those of 
you who elected me may I say 'Thank you'. And to those of you
who, while not actually casting your votes in my direction, have
since treated me with such kindness and courtesy, may I simply
say  'Ha ha ha'.
<P>
 But now that the moment of truth has arrived, for me at any rate,
I think it should be made clear to you what you have done. For
the first time in St. Andrews' long and distinguished history
you have elected a Silly Rector.  Where stood John Stuart Mill,
Balfour, Marconi, Kipling, Earl Haig, Smuts and Sir James Barrie,
now stands a 31-year-old  TV funnyman, a vir <I>definitely</I>
non majoris digniatis ac nominis,.... (please continue straight
on) an electronic buffoon who peddles jokes to the subversively
 inclined in order  to scrape together his humble fortune. The
day after the result was announced, in November, and while I was
still under sedation, a London newspaper published a photograph
of me. I was posed astride a motorcycle, with my teeth blacked
out, wearing knuckledusters and dressed as an elderly woman. Above
the photograph was the headline 'This is the Rector of St. Andrews'
and underneath the picture, the headline continued 'What is it
all coming to ?'. Now I doubt if many of you saw this because
the newspaper in question is called the <I>Sun</I>, which does
not have a very wide readership among those who enjoy the fruits
of a formidable education, but the thought nevertheless seemed
to me a very fair one. What's it all coming to ? Well, you have
had your moment of levity, and now this afternoon I have to pay
for it. I ask you quite seriously to consider my predicament.
I have now to deliver a Rectorial Address, something that I am
almost uniquely unqualified to do, since the one subject I might
talk about with any semblance of knowledge or authority, which
is Humour, is the most exquisitely dull and stupefying uninteresting
topic known to man, the Law of Real Property not excepted. And
yet, since I had not the courage to stay in that chair feigning
death, I now have to speak for some twenty minutes on a serious
subject, without, and this has been made very clear to me, without
in any way suplimenting it with comic songs, or bird noises, or
balancing on a bicycle, or exhibitions of even a mildly ventriloquial
nature. The requirement is a Rectorial Address and a Rectorial
Cabaret is not acceptable.
<P>
 I cannot even hope to be diverted by an enormous papier mache'
foot crashing down upon this platform or by a Colonel entering
the hall and bringing proceedings to a close by announcing that
the whole thing is too silly. I am limited to words alone, and
even then the dignity of this occasion precludes cheap sexual
innuendo or sustained passages of personal or political abuse,
inviting though the figure of our present Prime Minister is. I
may not even occasionally break away from my theme to recommend
commercial products. In addition this Address is being seen on
close circuit television, may be mentioned in the papers and worst
of all, worst of all is to be printed in full and kept in the
University Library for thousands upon thousands of succeeding
generations of  St. Andrews students to sneer at. Furthermore,
my agent tells me there is absolutely no question of a fee. There
is a phrase to cover this particular situation. It is something
to do with being on a hiding to nothing.
