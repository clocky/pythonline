	And why ? For one reason only, that cowardice is badly thought of. Now I would put it another way. I would say it is badly underrated. Dr. Johnson asserted that 'Mutual Cowardice keeps us in peace'. I believe it could, that this fundamentally realistic behaviour  could be a great force for social cohesion. And I suggest that the reason why there is so much more internecine behaviour within the human species than within any other species of animals is because cowardice has got itself a bad name.
	<P>Man is a social animal. So let us look at the behaviour of other social animals. Take the wolf  - he lives in a pack. Like man he is a hunter. Now, whenever a conflict breaks out between two members of a pack, either wolf can bring it to an immediate halt by making a ritual act of submission, by offering the side of his neck, his most vulnerable part, to his opponent. This immediately stops his opponent's aggressive behaviour. What a sensible system ! No feeling of shame for the submittor. Just peace.
	<P>A Canadian zoologist who had been studying wolves' behaviour tried this out in a human context. He was stopped by a traffic policeman for speeding. As the zoologist saw the policeman approaching his car he noticed that the policeman, for some reason, seemed particularly angry. So he adopted sensible wolf behaviour. First he got out of his car, because to remain seated while someone is talking to you is standing suggests superior status which is clearly not submissive. He then took off his spectacles, because spectacles have connotations of wide staring eyes, which in terms of animal behaviour is also aggressive. And then he stood hanging his head and offering the side of his neck to the cop. The policeman's anger immediately subsided, and the zoologist was let off. the ritual submission, the cowardly behaviour, had worked.
	<P>An interesting experiment. Nothing more perhaps. But these gestures of appeasement, these acts of ritual submission, are found in all social animals. Wherever there is trouble, gulls turn away their beaks, puppies roll on their backs, jackdaws offer the napes of their necks, dogs present their throats and baboons proffer their buttocks. And what happens ?  The stroppy gulls and dogs and jackdaws and baboons lay off. Peace reigns. But you and I have been conditioned to despise such sensible behaviour as the seagull's. And the carnage and distruction within the human species continues unabated.
