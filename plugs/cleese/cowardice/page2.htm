 Now as well as all this, there's one further snag. I've always
had the strongest dislike of public speeches of almost any kind.
Why I should have this prejudice against public speaking I don't
know. Perhaps, because many years ago I noticed that on pages
of advertisement in newspapers, offers of tuition in the art of
public speaking always seemed to be sandwiched between cures for
stammering and blushing on one hand, and recommended treatments
for haemorrhoids and nocturnal enuresis on the other. This association
has remained so strongly in my mind that I think I may subconsciously
assume that people speak in public only to compensate for the
humiliating nature of their private lives. But whatever the reason,
I harbour an aversion for public speaking so strong that until
today I have always managed to lie my way out of it. But now,
unless in the next few seconds I am fortunate enough to be struck
by a passing meteorite, I shall have to begin, and take responsibility
for twenty minutes of public embarrassment worthy of John Davies
himself, not to mention the most acute scenes of academic distress
since Ridley and Latimer went to the stake. The trouble is, I
haven't the slightest idea how to go about it. You see, there
aren't any little instruction manuals. No &quot;Teach Yourself
Rectorial Addressing&quot;, no &quot;Rectoring for Beginners&quot;.
These are books like &quot;Teach Yourself to Open Parliament&quot;
of  too limited appeal to interest publishers.

 All I have discovered is that I have to talk to you on some subject
of importance. At first I thought I might show you how to skin
an antelope, a trick I was taught years ago by my aunt Margery,
the great white huntress of  Islington. But it's rather technical
and a bit messy and the lectern isn't nearly large enough... next
I wondered if you all might like to learn how to imitate Mr. Health,
but then that involves tying long lengths of elastic round your
throat and gargling with rancid milk... and so, in my search of
likely topics I read other Rectorial Addresses, and found  that
moral qualities have been very popular in the past. But then to
my dismay I realised that all the good ones had been done. Courage
has gone. Sir James Barrie nicked that. And independence and magnanimity
and freedom... I've been left with things like good taste and
chastity. And frankly, I feel whatever I speak on I should have
some genuine feeling for. And the only quality that I am aware
of possessing more than my fellow man is that of physical cowardice.
I don't wish to boast, but I am widely regarded as one of Europe's
Six Leading Cowards. I have been a coward ever since I could run.
Cowadice runs in my family. The Duke of Wellington encountered
my great great grandfather running full pelt from the field at
Waterloo. He was merely anticipating Ambrose Bierce's definition
of a coward as 'one who in a perilous emergency, thinks with his
legs'. But the Duke didn't know this. 'Why', he thundered, 'are
you running away ?' 'I am running', replied my great-great, 'because
I am physically unable to fly'.
<P>
 Consequently I feel it is something I am qualified to talk about.
I know about cowardice. I put my own down to my sincere dislike
of physical pain. It is my ever present hope, as I rise from my
bed every morning, that this day my head will not get gashed,
and that no large men will try to force a tea chest down my throat.
Some nights I lie awake in bed, paralyzed by the thought that
one day I may be tortured for information, vital to the interests
of this country, which I do not possess.
<P>
 And because I have these quite normal fears, I am reviled as
a coward. At school my housemaster hated me because I was not
prepared to risk getting kneed in the head, simply to prevent
the Brown's House third from scoring another try against the North
Town third XV. It seemed to me that the adding of another three
points to their already enormous total was nothing compared with
the possibility of my sudden demise. And for this rational approach
my life was made a living hell.
