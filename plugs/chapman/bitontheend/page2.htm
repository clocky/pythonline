      Graham had died with brilliant timing on October 4<SUP>th</SUP>
1989, the very eve of the twentieth anniversary of the first recording
of Monty Python's Flying Circus, causing a huge celebratory party
to be cancelled in what Terry Jones called the greatest act of
party pooping in history.   Now we were gathered in St.Bart's
to remember this wonderful medical loony and the event was becoming
very silly indeed. I kept expecting Graham's Colonel to come in
and stop it. <BR>

     It soon began to turn from a memorial into a roast, from
a sad occasion into first an amusing and then an hilarious afternoon,
as one comedian after another piled up Graham stories.  I suppose
it was inevitable that an event stacked with so many funny people
couldn't keep serious for very long, and mercifully comedy kept
breaking out, so that by the end laughter liberated everyone from
sadness.<BR>

     John Cleese started it, startling everybody by declaiming
a parrot sketch parody - &quot;Graham Chapman is no more, he has
gone to meet his maker, he has rung down the curtain and joined
the choir invisible&quot; - because he said Graham would never
have forgiven him if he hadn't.   He ended by claiming to be the
first person to say fuck at a Memorial Service.<BR>
<P>
  The Fred Tomlinson singers led us all in a Chorus of Jerusalem
in Japanese or Jelusarem, as Graham used to sing.

    Tim Brooke-Taylor read the massage parlour episode from this
book. Mike Palin, hilarious as ever, spoke of how Graham was always
late.  For years Graham had prevailed on Michael's legendary niceness
by getting him to pick him up for rehearsal as he was &quot;on the way&quot;.  Michael, too nice
to say no would sit and stew for twenty minutes in the car outside
Graham's flat, always arriving late for rehearsal with a less
than apologetic Graham in tow. Occasionally during this morning vigil young men would poke their heads out of upstairs'
windows and say things like &quot;he'll be down in a minute&quot;
and &quot;he's nearly ready&quot;, further infuriating Michael.
He now confessed that he had been wondering about this whole twentieth
anniversary thing and couldn't see the point of it, but that Graham's
death had finally brought some meaning to it.  And in a very real
way, he confided, he believed that Graham was actually with us in the room today.  Well not right
now, but in another twenty minutes certainly...<BR>
