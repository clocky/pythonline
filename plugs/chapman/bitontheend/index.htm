     Life's a piece of shit
<P>
     When you look at it
<P>
     Life's a laugh and death's a joke its true.
<P>
     You'll see it's all a show
<P>
     Keep 'em laughing as you go
<P>
     Just remember that the last laugh is on you.
<P>
     So always look on the bright side of death...<BR>

  Its Graham Chapman's Memorial service, he has been dead less
than three months and I'm singing this in St. Barts Hospital Great
Hall, to a packed congregation each of whom has been issued hymn
sheets of the words of this song.  I can feel a huge giggle growing.
  Once again Python has slipped gently into a parody of the Church
of England.<BR>
