        Graham Chapman was a loony.   You can tell that from this
book.  After all it took four men to write his autobiography.
 Pretty fair, since it took about four men to live his life. 
  There was the quiet pipe-smoking tweed jacketed doctor, who
could elucidate complicated medical facts to the layman while
calmly diagnosing and dispensing medicines; there was the quiet
pipe-smoking writer who could sit all day painting his nails with
gestetner fluid occasionally interjecting the oddest comments,
squawks, shouts of &quot;Betty Marsden&quot; and injunctions to
sing &quot;Only Make Believe&quot; in a squeaky voice; there was
the quiet pipe-smoking homosexual, who could calmly bring a party
of Japanese boys down for breakfast in an extremely bourgeois
German suburban hotel, causing the manageress conniptions and
ending in a request that he move to a more suitable establishment;
and there was the quiet pipe-smoking alcoholic, who could reduce
any drinks party to a shambles by consuming half a distillery
and then crawling round the floor kissing all the men and groping
all the women.    But he wasn't all fun.<BR>

         He could get in a right rat bate; especially if you tried
to help him out.   In our stage show due to his tendency to take
a quick nip between numbers he was frequently late and would often
leave Mike Palin and Carol Cleveland waiting on stage for him.
 One night both John and I took it into our heads to fill in for
him, rather than have this embarrassing silence from the audience
and we were both rather startled to find ourselves facing each other across the
stage.   We fell into Graham's part and acted it out one behind
the other until Graham finally staggered on huffing and puffing.
Instead of the quiet word of thanks we expected at the end of
the show, he was completely furious with us, yelling and screaming.
 We didn't try it again.<BR>

      Jonathan Lynn observed that Graham was the only true anarchist
in Monty Python.  He could really only thrive in chaos. Fortunately
in Monty Python there was always plenty of it about.  I can remember
filming the TV series and Graham nipping in to a Bank to cash a cheque dressed as Biggles.  &quot;Its
alright&quot; he said to the startled cashier &quot;I am a Doctor.&quot;

   It was really as Brian that he achieved his finest work. Recently,
and painfully, cured of his alcoholic addiction, he threw himself
into the role of the man who is mistaken for the Messiah with
typical Graham dedication.   Not only did he spend long hours filming every day, but instead of crawling off
to swim or sleep like the rest of us, at lunchtime and in the
evening he reverted to his doctor persona and gave surgeries for
the crew and local Tunisians.<BR>

<P>
      There is something very chilling about turning up for a
days work and finding a cross with your name on it. We spent three
days being crucified and it certainly focuses the mind wonderfully.
 I suspect it was important for all of us but David Sherlock told
me it had been particularly meaningful for Graham since he had
finally come to terms with himself.<BR>

<P>
     What shines through this book is his staggering honesty -
the brilliance of truth that only a self-proclaimed liar could
achieve.    Facts and stories we would have murdered our grandmothers
to conceal are cheerfully paraded for our edification.  This is
life viewed as comedy, that only a doctor faced constantly with
the physical comedy of our bodies can see.<BR>

<P>
     He taught us not to respect doctors - they are after all
only ex-medical students - and to be honest with our emotions.
&quot;Well its better than bottling it up&quot; would be
<P>
Graham's credo. &quot;After all who of us in our lives hasn't
set fire to some great public building or other...&quot;<BR>

     In October 1989 as Graham lay dying I was editing a collection
of Python songs, and had been searching in vain for the original
recording of a song Graham and I wrote together called &quot;Medical
Love Song&quot;.  I finally found it the day he died, and played
it with tears rolling down my cheeks as Graham sang:<BR>

<P>
             &quot;I left my body to science
<P>
              But I'm afraid they turned it down.&quot;<BR>
