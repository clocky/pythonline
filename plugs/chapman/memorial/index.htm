<h2>Michael Palin's tribute, first appeared
October 6, 1989, in The Guardian:</H2>
<BR>
<Font SIZE=4>I first heard of Graham Chapman as one of that pool of ex&#173;Oxbridge
revue talent that sloshed around the BBC in the mid&#173;1960s.
<BR>
<BR>
I use the word sloshed advisedly, for many of our best times were
had propping up the various bars of the Corporation. Graham was
like a figure out of a Biggles story. Strong, finely chiselled
features, pipe at a jaunty angle in his mouth, pint in one hand
and progger in the other. A progger was Graham's name for the
flat&#173;ended instrument which he used to bed down the tobacco
in his pipe. I never knew whether it was a real name or not. Graham
liked words and used them well, but if he felt the right one didn't
exist he'd invent another one.<BR>
<BR>
In the post&#173;Cambridge days he was a journeyman writer, like
us all. One day he would be working with John Cleese to produce
a dazzling succession of successful sketches for The Frost Report,
the next he would be writing filler jokes for the Petula Clark
show.<BR>
<BR>
He kept a low profile as a performer until At Last the 1948 Show
in which he revealed a talent for playing intense, rather serious
characters hilariously. He was a charismatic performer, drawing
the eye to himself, as much for the originality and un&#173;showbizziness
of his approach, as for the likely detectable hint of unpredictability.
An audience was never quite sure what he would do next. Nor I
think, as a performer, was Graham. During a singing court scene
in one of the early Python shows he quite inadvertently substituted
'window dresser' for 'window clearer' in his song. A Freudian
slip at which we all fell about, especially Graham.<BR>
<BR>
In 1969, when the mutual admiration society which became known
as Monty Python assembled, Graham met David Sherlock and embarked
on one of the many radical changes in his life, when they decided
to live together. It was a courageous decision, which shocked
some of his friends at the time but was borne out triumphantly
by the fact that they shared the rest of their lives. David, together
with their adopted son John Tomiczak, nursed and cared for him
with stoic patience and quiet strength throughout his final illness.
<BR>
<BR>
Graham's need to relax himself with a dram or two took a disproportionate
hold on his life as the pressures of a heavy Python schedule grew.
Drink was not always the friend he thought it, affecting his performances
and occasionally doing a great disservice to a much underrated
natural acting talent. <BR>
His writing contributions to Python were of quality rather than
quantity. Whilst all around were scratching their heads for inspiration.
Graham would puff his pipe and glance sideways at the Times crossword
and be quite silent for 30 minutes or so before coming out with
a single shaft of inspiration that would transform a mundane sketch
into something very mad and wonderful.<BR>

<P>
Such surreal flashes were the very essence of Python as were his
memorable performances as the Colonel, as the Hostess in the Eurovision
song contest, Raymond Luxury-Yacht and others.<BR>

<P>
His off&#173;stage performances included collecting an award from
the Sun newspaper by leaping high in the air, emitting a loud
squawk and crawling all the way back to his table with the award
in his mouth, leaving Lord Mountbatten, who had given him the
award, looking very confused.<BR>

<P>
But Graham's most memorable performances were sustained and demanding-as
King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Brian in the
Life of Brian.<BR>

<P>
Around the time of the filming of Life of Brian, Graham made a
conscious effort to free himself from the dependence on the large
G and Ts-after that &quot;ice but no lemon please. &quot; His
restless ever&#173;inquisitive need to be freed from the boring
and the conventional had led him to the brink, but his cautious
disciplined rational side saved him at the last minute from toppling
over. He gave up drinking and later, with immense difficulty also
laid aside his pipe.<BR>

<P>
Perhaps Graham too easily overestimated the talents of others
while underestimating his own and, as a result, his ventures outside
Python-Out of the Trees for the BBC and his two films, Odd Job
and Yellowbeard - were full of good ideas badly resolved. The
commercial failure of Yellowbeard depressed him.<BR>

<P>
His recent illness was another in a series of mountains which
Graham had to climb. He always regarded death as highly overrated
and could never understand why anybody made such a fuss about
it. Despite great physical discomfort he remained alert, informed,
articulate and humorous.<BR>

<P>
He hated to be bored which is why he joined the Dangerous Sports
Club and once hurled himself into thin air attached to a length
of rubber&#133; &quot;I was high for two weeks after that.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
I suspect he would have enjoyed an old age of increasing eccentricity,
dispensing his considerable wisdom and hospitality, occasionally
leaping in the air and shouting &quot;Eeke!&quot;<BR>
