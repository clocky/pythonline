<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Greetings and thanks from the bottom of my heart
and the heart of my bottom to all  those of you who have taken
trouble to leave messages and kind words on my 65th birthday.
I was very touched. However the time has come for me to toss aside
this thin veil of politeness and reveal myself as the miserable
bastard I really am. I suffer, as you know, from being referred
to in some circles as the nice Python. I am extremely fed up with
this handle. There are many Pythons nicer than me. Mother Teresa
for instance. I know she's not a real Python but she was always
sending us jokes and it was Mother Teresa who stood bail for Graham
Chapman when he was bitten in the back by a mad dwarf in a London
night-club. You didn't know that did you? Of course not, because
it isn't true. It's a lie. And lying isn't nice is it? But that's
the sort of person I am. I lie all the time. I also harbour strange
and disturbing thoughts such as - if Mother Teresa had been in
the Fish Slapping Dance instead of me would John Cleese have knocked
her in the canal with a halibut? Of course not. On the day, John
being a nicer Python than me would have found some excuse to avoid
whacking Mother Teresa with a halibut.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Hallo, Mother Teresa. I'm John Cleese. I'm
playing the one who is supposed to knock you into the canal with
an halibut...&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Oh yez, you are my favourite. Your silly wanks
skit is very good. You should one day write a series about a man
who keeps a hotel and hits people who are Spanish.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Well, that's frightfully kind of you, I may
do that Mother Teresa.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;I think hitting Spanish people is very funny&#133;&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Yes, well, super. Which actually brings me
on to&#133;&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;You are going to hit me today, I think...&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Well, I've been thinking about it a bit and
er... I don't think it's very funny after all. I think it would
be better if I gave you an Award For Services To Humanity.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;No, hit me...&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;I'm afraid I have too much admiration for you,
Mother...may I call you &quot;Mother&quot;?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Hit me, you stupid sod. What are people going
to think if I put on a pith helmet and do a silly little dance
and flick you lightly round the ears with a pair of pilchards
and then you give me an Award For Services To Humanity? Where's
the joke in that, dickhead?&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;It's just that hitting an old lady is not a
nice thing to do...&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Oh, bollocks! If it were Terry Jones dressed
as an old lady you'd knock him off the Eiffel Tower!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Look, I'm sorry you feel that way Mother, but&#133;&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;You are a great disappointment to me, Mr. Cleese.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Well, you're a wonderful person and I'm not
worthy..&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Piss off you old tart. Get me that Michael
Palin. He'd hit me with a halibut.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;I don't think he would Mother. He's the nice
Python.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>&quot;Nice&#133; him? He's a right little bastard.
I sent him a letter once asking to be President of Poppadums for
Christ and he told me to go and jump in the Bay of Bengal.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Well, after reading gross and profane slanders like
that who could possibly believe that I am the nice Python. In
fact I'm thinking of invading Poland next week. And having myself
tattooed. Oh, and I'm a Satanist. And I once lent Hillary Clinton
money for a house&#133;<BR>
