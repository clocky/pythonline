<FONT SIZE=4>A soggy Palin waves cheerfully as he is pulled out
of the lock at Teddington after the silliest Python bit ever -
the frankly stupid Fish Slapping Dance, which we shot as part
of a 16 minute Python insert in a Eurovision programme celebrating
May Day.  We shamelessly recycled the piece in the next Python
series as it was so gloriously inane, and is still the favorite
sketch of many of us.  If any one knows the whereabouts or has
a copy of this May Day program they should please contact us and
we will reward them&#133;</FONT>
