<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>No sooner had I stepped off the plane (unfortunately
a split second before it reached the jetty) than I was stopped
by a group of men disguised as John Cleese (the masks were uncannily
lifelike but as three of them were under five foot tall it was
a bit of a give-away).  Anyway one got on the other's shoulders
and offered me a part in a new film, written by John Cleese, and
called &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;.  I told them I had already
appeared in a film called &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot; and that
the experience had affected me so badly I had been forced to hide
in the Pacific Rim for a year.  The man told me that they were
doing some extra shots on the film and that I would have a very
good time and my dressing room would always be full of strawberries
and if I ever wanted to learn French, there were girls available.
 I said thank you very much but I had a book to write about my
journey around the Pacific Rim and it would take me until the
new year to finish it.  He then punched me hard in the face and
said that Mr. Cleese was not used to being turned down and that
if I didn't co-operate he could get nasty and start using some
Dutch words. So I agreed to be in the film &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;
for the second time, and when I arrived at the studio and the
let me out of the trunk of the car who should I see but my old
friends Jamie Lee Klein and Kevin Curtis I was especially pleased
to remember their names as it was a year since I last saw them.
 &quot;Hi Ronnie&quot; they cried.  It was as if no time had passed
at all.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>My dressing room is small but has a bed, chair, bucket
and a bell which I can ring for assistance.  On set I am required
to dress as a bee.  John says that everything I say is much funnier
if I am dressed as a bee.  (He himself was dressed as a kangaroo
for a while which was convenient as he could keep his script and
copy of &quot;Swedish Bombshells&quot; in his pouch).  He is not
keen to let anyone look at his copy of &quot;Swedish Bombshells&quot;.
He says it's all about transport.  Well cycling, mainly.  He showed
me some of the pictures of bicycles I asked him why they all had
stark naked women  next to them.  He called me a dickhead and
said it was to stop them falling over.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>It's hot being in a bee suit, even in England in
September.  It's made of concentric layers of sponge rubber and
coated with alternate stripes of yellow and black fur (artificial
fur of course, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT!  Highly inflammable but
politically correct, it says on the label).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>But now it's all over.  Late last Saturday - Sept
9th, I was woken in the middle of a terrible dream that Bob Dole
was measuring my inside leg and a face peered in through the bars
of my dressing room and told me that it was all right for me to
go home.  But as I tried to slip out of my bee costume for the
last time, I realised I was not alone&#133;..<BR>
