<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE=5>Michael Palin, 53, is at an undisclosed
destination in Chile today recovering from shock allegations published
in a German magazine, that he is the fattest of the Python team,
his wife said yesterday at their three-up, one-down, four bathroom,
no bedroom, two-library hideaway at No. 12 Coswell Street, Fairhazel
Gardens., Dewsbury, Nr.  Leeds, that her husband was bitterly
upset by the allegations of fatness, &quot;He says there is absolutely
no truth in the report.  It is a deliberate and malicious attempt
to blacken my husband&quot; (Michael is the only white Python)
&quot;and to force him into a totally unnecessary weight-loss
regime.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"SIZE=5>Other Python's were quick to rally
in Michael's defence, John. Cleese - the longest Python claimed
to have seen Michael during one of his brief trips back to England
from the filming of his new travel series. &quot; I saw Michael
briefly during, one of his trips back to England from the filming
of his new travel series&quot;, John recounted, pausing every
now and then to pull on a large pipe - part of the elaborate plumbing
facilities at the elegant West London house he shares with his
wife, four cats and a fucking great camel.  &quot;He honestly
didn't seem fat to me.  And I had a pretty good view of him from<I>
</I>where I was lying&quot;.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"SIZE=5>Terry Jones, the most tatooed Python,
also sympathised.  He told us, through an interpreter, that, in<B>
</B>his opinion, such personal speculation was &quot;drigginvaare
tonen.  Ik dik! Genuosveirre? ik dik. &quot;Ik fucking dik!&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"SIZE=5>Eric Idle, the Python with the lowest
blood pressure, was unavailable for comment &quot;It's just garbage&quot;
he said, &quot;the typical sort of story newspapers resort to
when Princess Diana hasn't been to the gym.&quot; Eric has been
through it all before.  He was outed in January last year and
still can't talk about the experience without being given some
money, &quot;Can you imagine it ? You wake up one morning and
there's your blood pressure all over the LA Times.  Complete strangers
come up to you in the street nudging each other and saying things
like &quot;110 over 50. Mr.Cool! It's like people knowing your
chest size.  Believe me, I understand what Michael's going through.&quot;
Terry Gilliam too is no stranger to this sort of attack.  Only
last year he<B> </B>was revealed to have more legs than any other
Python.  &quot;It hurts, believe me.  I have as many legs as the
next man, but when this sort of stupid rumour is printed in something
like Newsweek there are always going to be some people who'll
believe it.  Mud sticks, you know.&quot; Gilliam, a distant relation
of Siddartha, the founder of Buddhism, claims he is no longer
able to go shopping, &quot;I'm asked if I would like two cubicles
or if I want my socks delivered by truck.  &quot; And he<B> </B>can't
get away from it . Recently Shoeshine boys voted him &quot;Man
of the Year&quot;, and he's been approached to do a one-man version
of &quot;Chorus Line&quot; on Broadway.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"SIZE=5>Michael's doctor poo-pooed the magazine's
claims that his patient has become pregnant for a bet.  &quot;Believe
me,</FONT><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times New Roman"> there
is no way Michael is going to become pregnant at his age.&quot;
