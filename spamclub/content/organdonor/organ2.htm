You can send your kneecap to Cindy Crawford (for example). Or you could donate parts of your lower intestine to an ex-lover, in loving memory of the great time you had when you were breaking up. E-mail an elbow to an elderly relative. Have you promised your anus to anyone after you're dead? Of course you haven't. But think of the joy you can bring by just promising people they can have your asshole after you have finished using it! It's easy - all you have to do is <A href="organ3.htm"><IMG SRC="click.gif" border=0></A>, fill out a simple e-mail form and we will do the rest.
