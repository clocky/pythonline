 <B>Nobby:</B> This is rather an obnoxious sign I'm afraid. You
tend to shout &quot; 'ello mate, what you havin' then?&quot; loudly
in bars. If you are a female Nobby this is a particularly useless
sign as you are hardly likely to want to join a bunch of chaps
shouting &quot;Oy look at the tits on that one.&quot;<BR>
