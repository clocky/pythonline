<font size=4><b>The tinne itself was sat down for trial at the Old Bailey for the manslaughter of Jaymey Lamprey (pretty boy of the Parish of St. Stephen) whence it was for its own safety committed to the Tower of London, where many of the great divines and scholars of the day did visit it and attempt to explain the mystery of its origin. Strange persistent rumours began - that Nell Gwynne did secretly visit it at night and perform for it 'a lewd and discreditable dance with an orange.' That it had the power to turn men into peacocks. That it contained a mysterious new meat whereof mankind did yet know nothing. Rumors of its strange powers to disturb and entice mankind grew and spread. It had apparently the power to cause miracles. A man in the Fleet was cured of having only one arm. He said he did pray to the Tynne and in the morning when he awoke he had no arms whatsoever. A common wench before the bench for being a mighty strumpet and showing of her bare posterious to a party of grad students was spared whipping and public mocking when she confessed that she had only been led into her wickedness by think evil thoughts of the tinne of spam. She was mercifully dispatched to the Colonies where she founded Canada.</b></font>
