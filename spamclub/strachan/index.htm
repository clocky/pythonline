I like a nice bit of Latin, don't you?  Adds a bit of class,
know what I mean?   
<P>
That's just what the Spam Club needs, I thought, a bit of class,
a bit of Latin, a nice motto and a little picture.  Any idea what
the Latin means?   Go on have a guess.<BR>

<P>
<I>&quot;De recta non tolerandum sunt&quot;<BR>
</I>
<P>
I first got into the rude Latin slogan business a few years ago
when I needed letter headings for my company Rutland Weekend Television.
 I decided the coat of arms would look much better with an authentic
Latin tag.  So I had a Latin expert translate my motto into Latin.
 Here's what he came up with:<BR>

<P>
 Futuaris Non Irresus Ridebis.<BR>

<P>
 Know what that means?<BR>

My publisher Geoffrey Strachan and his lewd Latin expert, Norman
Fyans, (who used to do cabaret with Peter Cook in the Footlights)
 spent many happy hours trying to translate the thought into authentic
Latin.  For example there are more elegant ways to express <I>Fuck
you </I>in Latin, but he wanted the flavour of Roman graffiti,
what the hoi polloi would have written on walls, not what Cicero
or Virgil might have said in the Senate.  Of course no translation
of one thought into another culture is easy.  Thus the actual
literal translation reads:<BR>

<!----PUNCH 2---->
<a name="punch2"></a>
<P><CENTER><a href="punch2.htm"><img src="images/button02.gif" alt="OK, Tell Me" border=0></a>

<!----PUNCH 3---->
<P><a name="punch3"></a>

So the Latin tag for the Spam Club, what does it mean?  Come on
guess!  No?   Oh all right.  It means:<BR>
<CENTER><a href="punch3.htm"><img src="images/button02.gif" alt="OK, Tell Me" border=0></a>
</CENTER>

<P>
Beats yer normal corporate logo don't it?  None of your &quot;Proud
as a Peacock&quot; NBC rubbish.  This gets down to the real nitty
gritty.  It's both a threat and a promise.<BR>

<P>
Or does it really?  I thought it did.  My first stab at the translation
was <I>Non recta tolerandum sunt </I>which I assumed meant  <I>No
assholes will be tolerated.  </I>I thought it lacked elegance
so I changed that to <I>De recta non tolerandum sunt, </I> which
I thought meant  &quot;<I>Concerning assholes, may they not be
tolerated.  </I>But did it really?  I decided to check with Python's
old publisher Geoffrey Strachan and his expert friend.  Here is
his amusing response.<BR>

Dear Eric,          9 - 7 - 96<BR>

<P>
 I'm sorry to have been a bit silent since my return from France:
I've been a bit preoccupied with various things.<BR>

<P>
 To return to NON RECTA TOLERANDUM SUNT and  DE RECTA NON TOLERANDUM
SUNT, my lewd Latin expert, with whom I have finally caught up
and had serious conversations, confirms the following grammatical
and stylistic points: - <BR>

<P>
 If you want to echo the terseness of 'NO ASSHOLES' you don't
need the SUNT. He also confirms that the gendire (sic) should
agree with the noun (i.e. neuter plural). He further suggests
that for emphasis (cf. DELENDA EST CARTHAGO) the noun should be
at the end of the sentence.<BR>

<P>
 Thus if you use the noun 'RECTUM' and the verb 'TOLERARE' (neither
of which are in my Latin dictionary) this would give you:<BR>

<P>
 NON TOLERANDA RECTA<BR>

<P>
On the other hand he goes on to suggest that you might prefer
to use: <BR>

<P>
 ANUS  ('fundament')
<P>
and PERMITTERE  (to 'allow, permit')<BR>

<P>
[both of which <U><B>are</B></U> in my dictionary.]<BR>

<P>
This would give you:<BR>

<P>
 NON PERMITTENDI ANI
<P>
 (second declenson i.e. masculine plural)<BR>

<P>
or if you prefer:<BR>

<P>
 ANI NON PERMITTENDI SUNT.
<P>
Or ANI NON SUNT PERMITTENDI.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Over to you.<BR>

<P>
  Yours,

SPAM Club members: What do you think? I think we should stay with
<BR>

<P>
- DE RECTA NON TOLERUNDUM SUNT - <BR>

and say it's Latin-American!<BR>
