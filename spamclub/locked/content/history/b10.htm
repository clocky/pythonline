<P><font size=4><b>Sir John Porridge denounced "the tynne" as the work of the devil. Sir Eldridge Cheaply mounted an expedition to search for "the source of the tynne of spamme." Spam fever gripped the town. Speculation in Spam shares became intense as no one knew what they had bought yet was desirous to have more.</b></font>
<P><font size=4><b>Parties were formed, some pro and some anti-Spam. Some argued that the Tynne should be opened, others that it should remained sealed for fear of the Plague, others that it should be burnt.
<P><font size=4><b>In the midst of this intense speculation, the Tynne of Spamme disappeared.
