<font size=4><b>A shocked Sir Thomas Pygge on being questioned before the coroner Sir Samuel Plume at St James' Magistrates Court did express and relate such a strange and terrible tale that the world was much affrighted, and the poor people began to moan and mutter that a terrible curse had fallen upon the world. At this time, Sir Thomas Pygge showed to the world a brightly painted metallic object no bigger than a man's hand. Its appearance was rectangular and on its highly coloured surface, the letters SPA and M could be made out (under the blood from the head of the late Jaymey Lamprey). This mysterious tinne of spamme caused much astonishment when news of its arrival reached the court. The City was for many days diverted and divided by intense speculation as to the nature and origin of this bright and mysterious shining tinne and what it might portend. Some assumed it was a covert signal for a general Catholic uprising. Others that it was a Dutch plot. Others that it was a warning of a great fire to come which would destroy almost two-thirds of the city.</b></font>
