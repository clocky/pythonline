Dear Eric,          9 - 7 - 96<BR>

<P>
 I'm sorry to have been a bit silent since my return from France:
I've been a bit preoccupied with various things.<BR>

<P>
 To return to NON RECTA TOLERANDUM SUNT and  DE RECTA NON TOLERANDUM
SUNT, my lewd Latin expert, with whom I have finally caught up
and had serious conversations, confirms the following grammatical
and stylistic points: - <BR>

<P>
 If you want to echo the terseness of 'NO ASSHOLES' you don't
need the SUNT. He also confirms that the gendire (sic) should
agree with the noun (i.e. neuter plural). He further suggests
that for emphasis (cf. DELENDA EST CARTHAGO) the noun should be
at the end of the sentence.<BR>

<P>
 Thus if you use the noun 'RECTUM' and the verb 'TOLERARE' (neither
of which are in my Latin dictionary) this would give you:<BR>

<P>
 NON TOLERANDA RECTA<BR>

<P>
On the other hand he goes on to suggest that you might prefer
to use: <BR>

<P>
 ANUS  ('fundament')
<P>
and PERMITTERE  (to 'allow, permit')<BR>

<P>
[both of which <U><B>are</B></U> in my dictionary.]<BR>

<P>
This would give you:<BR>

<P>
 NON PERMITTENDI ANI
<P>
 (second declenson i.e. masculine plural)<BR>

<P>
or if you prefer:<BR>

<P>
 ANI NON PERMITTENDI SUNT.
<P>
Or ANI NON SUNT PERMITTENDI.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
Over to you.<BR>

<P>
   X<BR>

<P>
 I'm intrigued to hear in your letter about John Goldstone's Python
text. I once wrote a piece for the <I><B>Bookseller</B></I> about
publishing silly books (after we'd been doing it for ten years).
 I'll see if I can find it.<BR>

<P>
 I hope you're all well.<BR>

<P>
  Yours,

SPAM Club members: What do you think? I think we should stay with
<BR>

<P>
- DE RECTA NON TOLERUNDUM SUNT - <BR>

and say it's Latin-American!<BR>
